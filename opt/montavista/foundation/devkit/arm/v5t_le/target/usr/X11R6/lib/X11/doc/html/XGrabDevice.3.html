<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The <i>XGrabDevice</i> request actively grabs control
of the device and generates <i>DeviceFocusIn</i> and <i>DeviceFocusOut</i> events. Further
device events are reported only to the grabbing client. <i>XGrabDevice</i> overrides
any active device grab by this client. event_list is a pointer to a list
of event classes.  This list indicates which events the client wishes to
receive while the grab is active. If owner_events is  <i>False</i> ,  all generated
device events are reported with respect to grab_window if selected. If owner_events
is  <i>True</i>   and if a generated device event would normally be reported to
this client, it is reported normally; otherwise, the event is reported
with respect to the grab_window, and is only reported if specified in the
event_list. <p>
If the this_device_mode argument is  <i>GrabModeAsync</i> , device
event processing continues as usual.  If the device is currently frozen
by this client,  then processing of device events is resumed. If the this_device_mode
 argument is <i>GrabModeSync</i> , the state of the device (as seen by client
applications) appears to freeze, and the X server generates no further
device events until the grabbing client issues a releasing  <i>XAllowDeviceEvents</i>
 call or until the device grab is released. Actual device changes are not
lost while the device is frozen;  they are simply queued in the server
for later processing. <p>
If other_devices_mode is  <i>GrabModeAsync</i> , processing
of events from other devices is unaffected by activation of the grab.  
If other_devices_mode is  <i>GrabModeSync</i>, the state of all devices except
the grabbed device  (as seen by client applications) appears to freeze,
<br>
 and the X server generates no further events from those devices until
the grabbing client issues a releasing  <i>XAllowDeviceEvents</i>  call or until
the device grab is released. Actual events are not lost while the devices
are frozen;  they are simply queued in the server for later processing.
<p>
If the device is actively grabbed by some other client, <i>XGrabDevice</i> fails
and returns <i>AlreadyGrabbed</i>. If grab_window is not viewable, it fails and
returns <i>GrabNotViewable</i>. If the device is frozen by an active grab of another
client, it fails and returns <i>GrabFrozen</i>. If the specified time is earlier
than the last-device-grab time  or later than the current X server time,
it fails and returns <i>GrabInvalidTime</i>. Otherwise, the last-device-grab time
is set to the specified time <i>( CurrentTime</i>  is replaced by the current
X server time). <p>
If a grabbed device is closed by a client while an active
grab by that client is in effect, the active grab is released.  If the device
is frozen only by an active grab of the requesting client, it is thawed.
<p>
<i>XGrabDevice</i> can generate <i>BadClass</i>, <i>BadDevice</i>, <i>BadValue</i>, and <i>BadWindow</i> 
errors. <p>
The <i>XUngrabDevice</i> request releases the device and any queued events
if this client has it actively  grabbed from either <i>XGrabDevice</i> or <i>XGrabDeviceKey</i>.
If other devices are frozen by the grab, <i>XUngrabDevice</i> thaws them. <i>XUngrabDevice</i>
does not release the device and any queued events if the specified time
is earlier than the last-device-grab time or is later than the current X
server time. It also generates <i>DeviceFocusIn</i>  and  <i>DeviceFocusOut</i>  events.
The X server automatically performs an  <i>UngrabDevice</i>  request if the event
window for an active device grab becomes not viewable. <p>
<i>XUngrabDevice</i> can
generate a <i>BadDevice</i> error. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Diagnostics</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><i>BadDevice</i> </dt>
<dd>An invalid device was specified.
 The specified device does not exist or has  not been opened by this client
via <i>XOpenInputDevice</i>.  This error may also occur if the specified device
is the X keyboard or X pointer device. </dd>

<dt><i>BadValue</i> </dt>
<dd>Some numeric value falls
outside the range of values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range
is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type
is accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate
this error. </dd>

<dt><i>BadWindow</i> </dt>
<dd>A value for a Window argument does not name a defined
Window. </dd>
