<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
xdmxconfig - a graphical configuration tool
for Xdmx configuration files 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>xdmxconfig</b> [filename] 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<i>xdmxconfig</i>
reads, edits, and writes configuration files for the Xdmx server.  The grammar
for the configuration file is specified in the <a href='Xdmx.1.html'>Xdmx(1)</a>
 manual page. <p>
To start
from scratch, create a "New Global" and specify the name and overall dimensions
for the configuration.  Then use "New Display" to enter more displays. <p>
If
there is more than one configuration, the configuration name button will
bring up a selection menu. <p>
In the right-hand pannel, the left mouse button
will move the highlighted display at "tool resolution"; the middle mouse
button will move the highlighted display by a single pixel (at "wall resolution");
and the right mouse button will bring up a menu allowing the highlighted
display to be edited or deleted.  The arrow keys will also move the highlighted
display by a single pixel. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Bugs</a></h2>
Currently, entries with the <b>wall</b> keyword
are not editable, but will be preserved in the new output file. The tool
will quit when requested by the user, even if a configuration file has
not been written out (i.e., without warning).  The menu interaction should
be improved (menu entries that don't currently work should be greyed-out,
for example).  The Help button does not work.
