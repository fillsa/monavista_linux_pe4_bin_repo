<h2><a href="FAQ.html#TOC296">12. FETCHMAIL</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="TOC297" href="FAQ.html#TOC297">Q1201:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I run fetchmail, I get the error <i>SMTP listener doesn't like
recipient address xxx@localhost</i>.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A1201:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure that <i>localhost</i> is recognized as a domain that is to be
delivered locally. If you are using the default Exim run time
configuration, you'll see a line near the top like this:
</p>
<pre>
   domainlist local_domains = @</pre>
<p>
Change it to
</p>
<pre>
   domainlist local_domains = @ : localhost</pre>
<p>
<a name="TOC298" href="FAQ.html#TOC298">Q1202:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently using Exim with fetchmail and I'd like to use the RBL on
Exim, but will it work? Do I need to configure fetchmail any particular
way? As far as Exim knows, all mail is coming from 127.0.0.1. Will it
check the source address against RBL? Or will it check the <i>From:</i> header?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A1202:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;It will check 127.0.0.1 (not very useful). The point of the RBL is to
keep messages from black-listed hosts out of your machine. If you are
using fetchmail, you have got the messages into your machine before you
approach Exim. That kind of defeats the purpose of the RBL. The right
way to do this would be for the host from which you fetch your mail to
do the RBL checking and insert some kind of warning header for you to
test, as Exim does if you run RBL checks in warning mode.
