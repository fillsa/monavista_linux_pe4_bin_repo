<h2><a href="FAQ.html#TOC330">50. MISCELLANEOUS</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="TOC331" href="FAQ.html#TOC331">Q5001:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I arrange to allow a limited set of users to perform a limited
set of Exim administration functions? I don't want to put them all in
the <i>exim</i> group.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5001:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;See <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/userv/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/userv/</a>. Using <i>userv</i> you can
arrange (for example) for certain users to be able to invoke <i>mailq</i> or
<i>runq</i> or other preset commands as <i>exim</i> (or any other user, as configured)
with only <i>userv</i> configuration. If you want to check the particular Exim
options available you can easily do it with shell or Perl scripts and
<i>userv</i> configuration, and provided you know how to do argument
&#147;unparsing&#148; properly in shell or Perl it will be secure.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC332" href="FAQ.html#TOC332">Q5002:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to &#147;tail&#148; the Exim log, but I have a number of other logs I also
want to &#147;tail&#148;, and the number of tailing windows is getting to be a
nuisance.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5002:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Look for a program called <i>xtail</i> (despite its name, it's not an
X-windows application). It allows you to do multiple tails, even of
entire directories.
</p>
<p>
Alternately, get the GNU version of <i>tail</i>, from the GNU textutils
package (<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/textutils/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/textutils/</a>). GNU tail lets you run
<tt>"tail -f</tt>" on multiple files at the same time, although it doesn't work
on entire directories like <i>xtail</i> can. If you are running Linux, you
probably already have a version of GNU <i>tail</i> that can follow multiple
files.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC333" href="FAQ.html#TOC333">Q5003:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I persuade Exim to accept ETRN commands without the leading
# character?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5003:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the option
</p>
<pre>
   smtp_etrn_command = /usr/lib/sendmail -R $domain</pre>
<p>
This causes Exim to run that command, with <i>$domain</i> replaced by the
argument of ETRN. The default action of Exim is to require the # sign
in order to be RFC-compliant, and to run the equivalent of
</p>
<pre>
   smtp_etrn_command = /usr/lib/sendmail -R ${substr_1:$domain}</pre>
<p>
which uses the argument without the leading # as the value for the <b>-R</b>
option. You aren't restricted to running Exim with the <b>-R</b> option, of
course. You can specify any command you like, with any number of
arguments. In particular, you can pass over the IP address of the caller
via <i>$sender_host_address</i>. However, if you make use of expansion strings
in the arguments, each one must be entirely contained in a single
argument. For example, if you want to remove the first character of the
ETRN argument when it is @ or #, you could use
</p>
<pre>
   smtp_etrn_command = "/usr/lib/sendmail -R \
     \"${if match {$domain}{^[@#]}{${substr_1:$domain}}{$domain}}\""</pre>
<p>
The internal quotes are necessary because of the white space inside the
expansion string.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC334" href="FAQ.html#TOC334">Q5004:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've recently noticed that emails I send with a <i>Bcc:</i> line are being
delivered to their final destination with the <i>Bcc:</i> line still present.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5004:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Exim removes <i>Bcc:</i> lines only if you call it with the <b>-t</b> option (i.e.
when it is acting partly as an MUA). It does not remove <i>Bcc:</i> lines that
are present in incoming SMTP mail or command-line mail that does not
use <b>-t</b>. Indeed, it should not remove them, because only the
initiating software (i.e. the MUA) can tell what to do with <i>Bcc:</i>
lines; any MTA software has to leave them alone. This is what RFC 2822
has to say about <i>Bcc:</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The <i>Bcc:</i> field (where the &#147;Bcc&#148; means &#147;Blind Carbon Copy&#148;) contains
addresses of recipients of the message whose addresses are not to be
revealed to other recipients of the message.  There are three ways in
which the <i>Bcc:</i> field is used.  In the first case, when a message
containing a <i>Bcc:</i> field is prepared to be sent, the <i>Bcc:</i> line is
removed even though all of the recipients (including those specified
in the <i>Bcc:</i> field) are sent a copy of the message.  In the second
case, recipients specified in the <i>To:</i> and <i>Cc:</i> lines each are sent
a copy of the message with the <i>Bcc:</i> line removed as above, but the
recipients on the <i>Bcc:</i> line get a separate copy of the message
containing a <i>Bcc:</i> line.  (When there are multiple recipient
addresses in the <i>Bcc:</i> field, some implementations actually send a
separate copy of the message to each recipient with a <i>Bcc:</i>
containing only the address of that particular recipient.) Finally,
since a <i>Bcc:</i> field may contain no addresses, a <i>Bcc:</i> field can be
sent without any addresses indicating to the recipients that blind
copies were sent to someone.  Which method to use with <i>Bcc:</i> fields
is implementation dependent, but refer to the ``Security
Considerations'' section of this document for a discussion of each.</i>
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC335" href="FAQ.html#TOC335">Q5005:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I used <i>gv</i> 3.5.8 (<i>ghostview</i>) to try printing <i>spec.ps</i>. After every
printed page, the printer ejects a blank sheet. Is this something to do
with using &#147;letter&#148; rather than A4 paper?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5005:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be an effect of using <i>ghostview</i>. Although the PostScript
is generated for A4 pages, the size of the page images is such that they
should fit on a letter page (they are shorter than would normally be
used on A4 paper). If the PostScript file is sent directly to a
PostScript printer, there is no problem. An alternative is to get hold
of the <i>psutils</i> toolset, which is available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pub/psutils/psutils.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pub/psutils/psutils.tar.gz</a>.
It contains utilities for extracting pages (which can be useful for
double-sided printing) and for resizing pages. If you resize from A4 to
letter the text shrinks a bit, but should then be printable via
<i>ghostview</i>.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC336" href="FAQ.html#TOC336">Q5006:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why aren't there any man pages for Exim? I don't always carry my printed
documentation.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5006:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;A single man page which lists the command line options is provided in
file <i>doc/exim.8</i> in the Exim distribution. Several other forms of
online documentation are available. As well as plain ASCII text, the
there are two forms - Texinfo and HTML - which have a certain amount of
built-in indexing for ease of finding your way around. There are no man
pages apart from the command line one because the author of Exim hasn't
the time (or desire :-) to maintain yet another documentation format.
Besides, it is hard to know how to split the Exim manual up.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC337" href="FAQ.html#TOC337">Q5007:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I send a message using the <b>-t</b> command line option, Exim sends only
to the addresses within the message, not to those on the command line.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5007:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be some confusion in the Sendmail community about the
interpretation of recipient addresses on the command line if the <b>-t</b>
option is used. Some versions do one thing, and some another. Here is an
except from one version of the Sendmail documentation for <b>-t</b>:
</p>
<p>
<i>Read message for recipients. <i>To:</i>, <i>Cc:</i>, and <i>Bcc:</i> lines will
be scanned for recipient addresses. The <i>Bcc:</i> line will be
deleted before transmission. Any addresses in the argument
list will be suppressed, that is, they will not receive
copies even if listed in the message header.</i>
</p>
<p>
By default Exim follows this specification, and interprets addresses on
the command line as addresses not to send to. You can set
</p>
<pre>
   extract_addresses_remove_arguments = false</pre>
<p>
to change this behaviour so that command line addresses are added to the
addresses that are taken from the header lines.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC338" href="FAQ.html#TOC338">Q5008:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I set up a domain list to contain <i>*customer.com</i>, it matches
<i>customer.com</i> and <i>abc.customer.com</i> as required, but it also matches
<i>noncustomer.com</i>, which is wrong. How can I get round this?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5008:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to specify two entries in the list:
</p>
<pre>
   customer.com : *.customer.com</pre>
<p>
because * in a domain list matches any characters, including <tt>.</tt> and
including a null sequence.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC339" href="FAQ.html#TOC339">Q5009:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to match all domains of the form <i>*.oyoy.org</i> but want a few
exceptions. For instance I don't want <i>foo.oyoy.org</i> or <i>bar.oyoy.org</i> to be
included. What is the best way to do this?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5009:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use negative items in the domain list, like this:
</p>
<pre>
   domainlist local_domains = !foo.oyoy.org : !bar.oyoy.org : *.oyoy.org</pre>
<p>
If there are many exceptions, you can use a lookup instead of listing
them all inline. If there are a number of exceptions that match a
particular pattern, you could use a regular expression.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC340" href="FAQ.html#TOC340">Q5010:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't seem to find a pre-built version of Exim anywhere. The machine
is a Sparc 5 running Solaris 2.6.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5010:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary distribution is source-only. However, some people have built
and distributed RPMs and debs for Linux systems, and ports for FreeBSD.
I haven't heard of anyone doing this for Solaris. The main problem with
binary distributions is that there are a number of build-time options,
requiring the answers to questions like:
</p>
<p>
. Which DBM library do you have? (On Solaris probably ndbm, but no easy
default on some other systems.)
</p>
<p>
. Which uid/gid do you want to use for Exim?
</p>
<p>
. Where do you want the configuration file to be? (Many different
answers, even on the same OS, depending on local policy.)
</p>
<p>
. Ditto for the binaries.
</p>
<p>
. Which optional bits of Exim do you want to include?
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC341" href="FAQ.html#TOC341">Q5011:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a version of Exim available that runs under Windows?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5011:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago somebody took a copy of the Exim source with the aim of
trying to port it to Windows NT. However, I never heard anything more.
However, current versions of Exim can be made to run under Cygwin.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC342" href="FAQ.html#TOC342">Q5012:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Exim support Delivery Status Notification (DSN), Message Status
Notification (MSN), or any other form of delivery acknowledgement?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5012:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;See <a href="FAQ_6.html#TOC201">Q0607</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC343" href="FAQ.html#TOC343">Q5013:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;What does &#147;Exim&#148; stand for?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5013:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, it was &#147;EXperimental Internet Mailer&#148;, which was the best I
could come up with when I was starting out. At that point it was
experimental - I wanted to see if the ideas I had for extending Smail's
approach actually worked. Then somebody discovered about it and wanted
to start using it, and told other people about it...
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC344" href="FAQ.html#TOC344">Q5014:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I haven't set <tt>check_spool_space</tt>, Exim is still checking the
amount of space on the spool for incoming SMTP messages that use the
SIZE option. Can I suppress this?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5014:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;The RFC for the SIZE option says:
</p>
<p>
<i>If the server currently lacks sufficient resources to accept a
message of the indicated size, but may be able to accept the
message at a later time, it responds with code ``452
insufficient system storage''.</i>
</p>
<p>
and that is what Exim is trying to implement. This is entirely
independent from <tt>check_spool_space</tt>, which says <i>don't accept any mail
if there is less than so much space in the spool partition</i>, though the
code is optimised to do both checks at the same time if required.
However, you can suppress the SIZE check if you want to, by unsetting
<tt>smtp_check_spool_space</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC345" href="FAQ.html#TOC345">Q5015:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I just noticed log entries that start off <tt>&#60;= &#60;&#62;</tt>. Am I correct in
assuming that the <tt>&#60;&#62;</tt> indicates that the envelope did not contain any
&#147;From&#148; data?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5015:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. This indicates a delivery failure report (aka a &#147;bounce message&#148;),
as specified in RFC 2821. The reason for using empty sender addresses is
to identify bounce messages so that they themselves do not cause further
bounces. Empty senders are also used for other kinds of report which
should not themselves cause the generation of bounce messages. For
example, Exim uses them when sending out warnings about delivery delays.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC346" href="FAQ.html#TOC346">Q5016:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've received a message which does not have my address in the <i>To:</i>
line. It is a spam message with the same address in both the <i>From:</i> and
the <i>To:</i> headers. How can this happen, and why doesn't Exim reject it?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5016:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an important distinction between the &#147;envelope&#148; from and to and
the &#147;header&#148; from and to. The former are sometimes called the &#147;sender&#148;
and &#147;recipient&#148;. An email message needs an &#147;envelope&#148; for the same
reason that paper mail does - the envelope tells the delivery mechanism
what to do with this copy of the message, whereas the <i>To:</i> header lists
all the recipients, including those who have been sent different copies
of the message because their mailbox is on some other host.
</p>
<p>
An MTA such as Exim works entirely with the &#147;envelope&#148; addresses, not
with those in the header lines. Don't try to block mail where envelope
from and the header from differ. There are common legitimate cases where
this happens, for example, messages forwarded from mailing lists and
delivery failure reports.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC347" href="FAQ.html#TOC347">Q5017:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can (or will) Exim ever handle a message delivery purely in memory,
that is, it is handled without it ever hitting the disk?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5017:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't, and never will. Accepting and delivering a message are two
entirely separate, independent processes, which communicate only by
writing/reading the message on the disk.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC348" href="FAQ.html#TOC348">Q5018:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am using dbm files for data that Exim reads, can I rebuild them
on the fly, or do I need to restart Exim every time I make a change?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5018:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Exim re-reads the file every time it consults it, so if you are using a
cdb or a DBM library that uses just a single file (i.e. not ndbm),
you can just build the new file with a temporary file name, and use
<i>mv</i> to rename it into the correct place on the fly. If there are two
files to rename, there is a window of time during which the DBM database
is inconsistent. On lightly loaded systems this may not matter.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC349" href="FAQ.html#TOC349">Q5019:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I need an option that is the opposite of <b>-bpa</b>, that is, a listing of
those addresses generated from a top-level address that have not yet
been delivered.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5019:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Exim does not keep this information. It saves only the top-level
addresses and the list of addresses that are finished with. At each
delivery attempt, generated addresses are recomputed from scratch. This
makes it possible to correct errors in redirection data that is
causing delivery delays. However, there is an option you can set on a
<tt>redirect</tt> router that changes things. It is called <tt>one_time</tt>, and if
it is set, the list of generated addresses gets added to the top-level
list at the first delivery attempt, and is never regenerated. Because
top-level address lists must be real email addresses, this option cannot
be used if any of the generated addresses are pipes, files, or
autoreplies.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC350" href="FAQ.html#TOC350">Q5020:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I make Exim receive incoming mail, queue it, but not attempt to
deliver it? I want to be in this state while moving some mailboxes.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5020:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set <tt>queue_only</tt> in the Exim configuration. Then kill your daemon,
and restart it without the <b>-q</b> option (i.e. with just the <b>-bd</b> option),
so that it does not spawn any queue runners. This stops all deliveries,
remote as well as local.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC351" href="FAQ.html#TOC351">Q5021:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;What does Exim use for POP and IMAP as a default?  Do I have to install
anything else?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5021:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Exim provides MTA functionality. That is, it delivers mail. POP and
IMAP are two of several ways of reading previously-delivered mail. Exim
does not provide that functionality. You need to install POP and/or IMAP
daemons; there are several to choose from. There is a mailing list at
<i>pop-imap@exim.org</i> for the discussion of POP/IMAP issues.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC352" href="FAQ.html#TOC352">Q5022:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an easy way of removing all queued messages at once in a safe
way?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5022:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Try this command:
</p>
<pre>
   exim -bp | awk '/^ *[0-9]+[mhd]/{print "exim -Mrm " $3}' | sh</pre>
<p>
<a name="TOC353" href="FAQ.html#TOC353">Q5023:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does Exim do <i>ident</i> callbacks by default? Isn't this just a waste
of resources? I've been told this is an ancient way of authentication.
Is it obsolete?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5023:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a common misunderstanding, at least partially resulting from the
incorrect naming of the protocol when it was first published.
The service on port 113 is an identification service, which allows a
target host to record information identifying the user responsible for
making a connection to it. The information may not be intelligible to
the recording host - it could, for example, be encrypted so that only
someone on the calling host can make sense of it. It is useful for
providing additional information in an audit trail.
</p>
<p>
At least one site has found <i>ident</i> effective against two rather
prevalent kinds of open proxy (whether already blacklisted at the RBLs
or not). An ACL statement is used to reject mail from servers that
return <i>ident</i> strings of <tt>squid</tt> and <tt>CacheFlow Server</tt>.
Snippets such as this in the RCPT ACL do the trick:
</p>
<pre>
   deny  condition = ${if eq{$sender_ident}{CacheFlow Server}{1}{0}}
     message = Rejected - appears to be an unsecured proxy: $sender_ident</pre>
<p>
The likelihood that a genuine mail process would return those specific
ident strings is vanishingly small.
</p>
<p>
The <i>ident</i> data should not be used for authentication in any form
except on a closed secure network between cooperating hosts (probably
not even then). The information from the source host is only as reliable
as the host itself. If it's not under your control then you have to
treat the information as opaque data that can be used only by the
sysadmin of the source system to trace back connection data. Some
<i>ident</i> implementations send out opaque cookies or DES encrypted
information. <i>Ident</i> is hugely useful at times - especially for
checking back on connections from multiuser machines (as opposed to
one-person desktop boxes).
</p>
<p>
You can stop Exim making ident calls by adding
</p>
<pre>
   rfc1413_query_timeout = 0s</pre>
<p>
to its configuration, but it is better to leave it active (reducing the
timeout to 10s or less if it is causing problems) - it costs very
little, and in cases of mail forgery from a multiuser system can track
the sinner concerned very quickly.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC354" href="FAQ.html#TOC354">Q5024:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I often have the problem that a message gets stuck in the mail queue and
I want it to be bounced to a certain address.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5024:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can do this using a combination of four command line options, like
this:
</p>
<pre>
   exim -Mf   14Fdlq-0003kM-00
   exim -Mmad 14Fdlq-0003kM-00
   exim -Mar  14Fdlq-0003kM-00  new@ddress
   exim -M    14Fdlq-0003kM-00</pre>
<p>
The first command freezes the message so that a queue runner won't start
to deliver it while you are changing things. The second command marks
all existing recipients as delivered. The third command adds a new
recipient, and the fourth command forces a delivery of the message,
which will cause it to be delivered to the new address, and then
deleted.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC355" href="FAQ.html#TOC355">Q5025:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;What precautions should I take when editing Exim's run time
configuration file?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5025:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Edit the file and save the result in a new file. Test the syntax of
the new file by running a command like this:
</p>
<pre>
   exim -bV -C exim.conf.new</pre>
<p>
That will check for syntax errors without disturbing your running
configuration. If you are paranoid enough, run, as <i>root</i>,
</p>
<pre>
   exim -C exim.conf.new &#60;some address&#62;
   &#60;some message&#62;
   .</pre>
<p>
and see if it delivers it. Carry on testing until happy. When happy,
</p>
<pre>
   mv exim.conf.new exim.conf
   kill -HUP `cat /var/spool/exim/exim-daemon.pid`</pre>
<p>
Then check the Exim log to be sure the daemon restarted OK. Watch the
log for a bit to see that mail is flowing.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC356" href="FAQ.html#TOC356">Q5026:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is exim able to use RFC 2645, <i>On-demand Mail Relay</i> (ODMR)?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5026:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;No.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC357" href="FAQ.html#TOC357">Q5027:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any way I can send bounces to the postmaster, and nobody else?
Basically, I want to receive them, and I don't want the reply/from
person to get them. If I think they need it I will forward it myself.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5027:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Put <tt>errors_to=postmaster</tt> on every router.
</p>
<p>
<a name="TOC358" href="FAQ.html#TOC358">Q5028:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I HUP the Exim daemon, the name shown in the process table changes
from <i>/usr/lib/sendmail</i> (which is a symlink) to the real binary name.
Can I change this?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5028:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Add this to your Exim configuration:

<font color="#00BB00">A5029:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the <b>-Mmd</b> command line option to mark a recipient address
&#147;delivered&#148;, which effectively removes it. If you are using the Bash
shell, you can enter non-printing characters using an escape sequence.
For example:
</p>
<pre>
   exim -Mmd 15HKvU-00013Q-00 $'\240'abc@x.y.z</pre>
<p>
In this example, the first character of the local part has a code value
of 240. If you are using a shell that does not support this, create the
command in a file and run it as a shell script.

<a name="TOC360" href="FAQ.html#TOC360">Q5030:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am using exim in a two queues scenario, with two different
configuration files. How can I run a second copy of <i>eximon</i> to
inspect and modify the alternate queue?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5030:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use these commands (or put them in a script):
</p>
<pre>
   EXIMON_EXIM_CONFIG=/your/path/exim/configure.alternate
   export EXIMON_EXIM_CONFIG
   /your/path/exim/bin/eximon</pre>

<a name="TOC361" href="FAQ.html#TOC361">Q5031:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there no sender address on bounce messages? It shows up as "&#60;&#62;".
</p>

<a name="TOC362" href="FAQ.html#TOC362">Q5032:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any Exim web-based administration scripts?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5032:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;No (as far as is known). It seems likely that producing one that is
generic enough would be a difficult task.

<a name="TOC363" href="FAQ.html#TOC363">Q5033:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I send a copy of all outgoing messages to another mailbox?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5033:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;The most straightforward way is to set up a system filter, and include
a command such as:
</p>
<pre>
   unseen deliver mailbox@whatever.domain</pre>
<p>
This sends a copy of every message to <i>mailbox@whatever.domain</i>
(unless the message already has that recipient - Exim never does
duplicate deliveries).
</p>
<p>
To save only &#147;outgoing&#148; messages, you need to come up with a
definition of what &#147;outgoing&#148; means. Typically, this might be a check
on the sender address and/or on the originating host. Here is an
example:
</p>
<pre>
   if $sender_address_domain is mydomain.com and
      ${mask:$sender_host_address/24} is 192.168.324.0/24
   then
     unseen deliver mailbox@whatever.domain
   endif</pre>
<p>
<a name="TOC364" href="FAQ.html#TOC364">Q5034:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any way to make the <tt>queue_only</tt> option conditional? I would
like the ability to queue messages from external sources while deliver
locally generated email as normal.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A5034:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no direct way of doing this. However, you can achieve the
effect. In one of your ACLs that checks incoming mail from external
sources, put
</p>
<pre>
   warn  control = queue_only</pre>
<p>
You can add other conditions as well, of course.
