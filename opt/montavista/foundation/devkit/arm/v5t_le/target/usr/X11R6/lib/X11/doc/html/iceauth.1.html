<p>
The <i>iceauth</i> program
is used to edit and display the authorization  information used in connecting
with ICE.  This program is usually used to extract authorization records
from one machine and merge them in on  another (as is the case when using
remote logins or granting access to other users).  Commands (described below)
may be entered interactively, on the <i>iceauth</i> command line, or in scripts.
