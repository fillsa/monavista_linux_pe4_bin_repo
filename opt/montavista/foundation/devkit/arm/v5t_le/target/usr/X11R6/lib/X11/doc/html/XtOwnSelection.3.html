<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The
<i>XtOwnSelection</i>   function informs the Intrinsics selection mechanism that
a widget believes it owns a selection. It returns  <i>True</i>   if the widget
has successfully become the owner and  <i>False</i>   otherwise. The widget may
fail to become the owner if some other widget  has asserted ownership at
a time later than this widget. Note that widgets can lose selection ownership
either  because someone else asserted later ownership of the selection
 or because the widget voluntarily gave up ownership of the selection. Also
note that the lose_selection procedure is not called  if the widget fails
to obtain selection ownership in the first place. <p>
The <i>XtOwnSelectionInrcremental</i>
  procedure informs the Intrinsics incremental selection mechanism that
the specified widget wishes to own the selection. It returns <i>True</i>   if the
specified widget successfully becomes the selection owner or <i>False</i>   otherwise.
For more information about <i>selection</i>, <i>target</i>, and <i>time</i>, see Section 2.6
of the <i>Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</i>. <p>
A widget that becomes
the selection owner using <i>XtOwnSelectionIncremental</i>   may use <i>XtDisownSelection</i>
  to relinquish selection ownership. <p>
The <i>XtDisownSelection</i>   function informs
the Intrinsics selection mechanism that the specified widget is to lose
ownership of the selection. If the widget does not currently own the selection
either  because it lost the selection  or because it never had the selection
to begin with, <i>XtDisownSelection</i>   does nothing. <p>
After a widget has called
<i>XtDisownSelection</i>,   its convert procedure is not called even if a request
arrives later  with a timestamp during the period that this widget owned
the selection. However, its done procedure will be called if a conversion
that started  before the call to <i>XtDisownSelection</i>   finishes after the
call to <i>XtDisownSelection</i>.
