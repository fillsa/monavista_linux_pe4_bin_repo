Now aumix is maintained under CVS.  You can browse the sources with a Web
browser.  The main site is in the USA at
<URL:http://206.111.193.41/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/>, and there is a mirror site in
Germany at <URL:http://grappa.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/cgi-bin/cvsweb/?cvsroot=aumix>.

You can download a complete copy of the CVS repository via CVSup, by using
<URL:http://jpj.net/~trevor/aumix/aumix-supfile.txt>.  See
<URL:http://www.cvsup.org/> for more information about CVSup.  Thanks to
Christian Weisgerber for configuring CVSup.

You can also download a copy of the CVS repository via rsync.  See
<URL:http://grappa.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/> for instructions.

At <URL:http://206.111.193.41/daily/> are snapshots of the sources which are
prepared automatically once a day.  These snapshots contain the files generated
by aclocal, autoheader, automake, autoconf, and msgmerge, so you need not
install those utilities.

As yet there is no anoncvs access.

The mailing list has moved.  Its Web page is now at
<URL:http://lilax.org/wws/info/aumix-l> (requires JavaScript).  To send a
message to the list, write to <aumix-l@lilax.org>.  For directions on using the
list software via e-mail instead of over the Web, write to <sympa@lilax.org>
with just the word "help" (no quotes) in the subject.  As an anti-spam measure,
messages from non-subscribers are held for moderation.
