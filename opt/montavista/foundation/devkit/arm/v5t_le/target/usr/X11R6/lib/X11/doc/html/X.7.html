X - a portable, network-transparent
window system 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<p>
The X Window System is a network transparent window
system which runs on a wide range of computing and graphics machines.  It
should be relatively straightforward to build the X.Org Foundation software
distribution on most ANSI C and POSIX compliant systems.  Commercial implementations
are also available for a wide range of platforms. <p>
The X.Org Foundation requests
that the following names be used when referring to this software: <p>
<center>X<br>
X Window System <br>
X Version 11 </center> <br>
X Window System, Version 11 <br>
X11 <p>
<i>X Window System</i> is a trademark of The Open Group. 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
X Window
System servers run on computers with bitmap displays. The server distributes
user input to and accepts output requests from various client programs
through a variety of different interprocess communication channels.  Although
the most common case is for the client programs to be running on the same
machine as the server, clients can be run transparently from other machines
(including machines with different architectures and operating systems)
as well. <p>
X supports overlapping hierarchical subwindows and text and graphics
operations, on both monochrome and color displays. For a full explanation
of the functions that are available, see the <i>Xlib - C Language X Interface</i>
manual,  the <i>X Window System Protocol</i> specification, the <i>X Toolkit Intrinsics
- C Language Interface</i> manual, and various toolkit documents. <p>

Many other utilities, window managers, games, toolkits, etc. are included
as user-contributed software in the X.Org Foundation distribution, or are
available using anonymous ftp on the Internet. See your site administrator
for details. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Starting Up</a></h2>
<p>
There are two main ways of getting the X server
and an initial set of client applications started.  The particular method
used depends on what operating system you are running and whether or not
you use other window systems in addition to X. 
<dl>

<dt><b><i>xdm</i> (the X Display Manager)</b>
</dt>
<dd>If you want to always have X running on your display, your site administrator
can set your machine up to use the X Display Manager <i>xdm</i>.  This program
is typically started by the system at boot time and takes care of keeping
the server running and getting users logged in.  If you are running <i>xdm</i>,
you will see a window on the screen welcoming you to the system and asking
for your username and password.  Simply type them in as you would at a normal
terminal, pressing the Return key after each.  If you make a mistake, <i>xdm</i>
will display an error message and ask you to try again.  After you have
successfully logged in, <i>xdm</i> will start up your X environment.  By default,
if you have an executable file named <i>.xsession</i> in your home directory, <i>xdm</i>
will treat it as a program (or shell script) to run to start up  your initial
clients (such as terminal emulators, clocks, a window manager, user settings
for things like the background, the speed of the pointer, etc.). Your site
administrator can provide details. </dd>

<dt><b><i>xinit</i> (run manually from the shell)</b> </dt>
<dd>Sites
that support more than one window system might choose to use the <i>xinit</i>
program for starting X manually.  If this is true for your  machine, your
site administrator will probably have provided a program  named "x11",
"startx", or "xstart" that will do site-specific initialization (such as
loading convenient default resources, running a window manager,  displaying
a clock, and starting several terminal emulators) in a nice way.  If not,
you can build such a script using the <i>xinit</i> program. This utility simply
runs one user-specified program to start the server, runs another to start
up any desired clients, and then waits for either to finish.  Since either
or both of the user-specified programs may be a shell  script, this gives
substantial flexibility at the expense of a nice interface.  For this reason,
<i>xinit</i> is not intended for end users. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Display Names</a></h2>
<p>
From the user's perspective,
every X server has a <i>display name</i> of the form: <p>
<center><i>hostname:displaynumber.screennumber</i></center>
<p>
This information is used by the application to determine how it should
connect to the server and which screen it should use by default (on displays
with multiple monitors): 
<dl>

<dt><i>hostname</i> </dt>
<dd>The <i>hostname</i> specifies the name of the
machine to which the display is physically connected.  If the hostname is
not given, the most efficient way of  communicating to a server on the
same machine will be used. </dd>

<dt><i>displaynumber</i> </dt>
<dd>The phrase "display" is usually
used to refer to collection of monitors that share a common keyboard and
pointer (mouse, tablet, etc.).  Most workstations tend to only have one keyboard,
and therefore, only one display.  Larger,  multi-user systems, however, frequently
have several displays so that more than one person can be doing graphics
work at once.  To avoid confusion, each display on a machine is assigned
a <i>display number</i> (beginning at 0) when the X server for that display is
started.  The display number must always be given in a display name. </dd>

<dt><i>screennumber</i>
</dt>
<dd>Some displays share a single keyboard and pointer among two or more monitors.
Since each monitor has its own set of windows, each screen is assigned
a <i>screen number</i> (beginning at 0) when the X server for that display is
started.  If the screen number is not given, screen 0 will be used. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
On POSIX
systems, the default display name is stored  in your DISPLAY environment
variable.  This variable is set automatically by the <i>xterm</i> terminal emulator.
 However, when you log into another machine on a network, you will need
to set DISPLAY by hand to point to your display.  For example, <p>
<br>
<pre>    % setenv DISPLAY myws:0
    $ DISPLAY=myws:0; export DISPLAY
</pre>The <i>xon</i> script can be used to start an X program on a remote machine; it
automatically sets the DISPLAY variable correctly. <p>
Finally, most X programs
accept a command line option of  <b>-display <i>displayname</i></b> to temporarily override
the contents of DISPLAY.  This is most commonly used to pop windows on another
person's screen or as part of a "remote shell" command to start an xterm
pointing back  to your display.  For example, <p>
<br>
<pre>    % xeyes -display joesws:0 -geometry 1000x1000+0+0
    % rsh big xterm -display myws:0 -ls &lt;/dev/null &amp;
</pre><p>
X servers listen for connections on a variety of different  communications
channels (network byte streams, shared memory, etc.). Since there can be
more than one way of contacting a given server, The <i>hostname</i> part of the
display name is used to determine the type of channel  (also called a transport
layer) to be used.  X servers generally support the following types of connections:

<dl>

<dt><i>local</i> </dt>
<dd><br>
The hostname part of the display name should be the empty string. For example:
 <i>:0</i>, <i>:1</i>, and <i>:0.1</i>.  The most efficient local transport will be chosen. </dd>

<dt><i>TCP/IP</i>
</dt>
<dd><br>
The hostname part of the display name should be the server machine's IP
address name.  Full Internet names, abbreviated names, and IP addresses
are all allowed.  For example:  <i>x.org:0</i>, <i>expo:0</i>, <i>198.112.45.11:0</i>, <i>bigmachine:1</i>,
and <i>hydra:0.1</i>. </dd>

<dt><i>DECnet</i> </dt>
<dd><br>
The hostname part of the display name should be the server machine's  nodename,
followed by two colons instead of one. For example:  <i>myws::0</i>, <i>big::1</i>, and
<i>hydra::0.1</i>. </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Access Control</a></h2>
An X server can use several types of access control.
 Mechanisms provided in Release 6 are: <br>
<pre>
    Host Access<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;Simple host-based access control.
    MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;Shared plain-text "cookies".
    XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;Secure DES based private-keys.
    SUN-DES-1<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;Based on Sun's secure rpc system.
    MIT-KERBEROS-5<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;Kerberos Version 5 user-to-user.
</pre><p>
<i>Xdm</i> initializes access control for the server and also places authorization
information in a file accessible to the user. Normally, the list of hosts
from which connections are always accepted should be empty, so that only
clients with are explicitly authorized can connect to the display.  When
you add entries to the host list (with <i>xhost</i>), the server no longer performs
any authorization on connections from those machines.  Be careful with this.
<p>
The file from which <i>Xlib</i> extracts authorization data can be specified with
the environment variable <b>XAUTHORITY</b>, and defaults to the file <b>.Xauthority</b>
in the home directory.  <i>Xdm</i> uses <b>$HOME/.Xauthority</b> and will create it or
merge in authorization records if it already exists when a user logs in.
<p>
If you use several machines and share a common home directory across all
of the machines by means of a network file system, you never really have
to worry about authorization files, the system should work correctly by
default. Otherwise, as the authorization files are machine-independent, you
can simply copy the files to share them. To manage authorization files,
use <i>xauth</i>. This program allows you to extract records and insert them into
other files.  Using this, you can send authorization to remote machines
when you login, if the remote machine does not share a common home directory
with your local machine. Note that authorization information transmitted
``in the clear'' through a network file system or using <i>ftp</i> or <i>rcp</i> can be ``stolen''
by a network eavesdropper, and as such may enable unauthorized access. In
many environments, this level of security is not a concern, but if it is,
you need to know the exact semantics of the particular authorization data
to know if this is actually a problem. <p>
For more information on access control,
see the <i>Xsecurity</i> manual page. 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Geometry Specifications</a></h2>
One of the advantages
of using window systems instead of hardwired terminals is that  applications
don't have to be restricted to a particular size or location on the screen.
Although the layout of windows on a display is controlled by the window
manager that the user is running (described below),  most X programs accept
a command line argument of the form <b>-geometry <i>WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF</i></b> (where
<i>WIDTH</i>, <i>HEIGHT</i>, <i>XOFF</i>, and <i>YOFF</i> are numbers) for specifying a preferred size
and location for this application's main window. <p>
The <i>WIDTH</i> and <i>HEIGHT</i> parts
of the geometry specification are usually measured in either pixels or
characters, depending on the application. The <i>XOFF</i> and <i>YOFF</i> parts are measured
in pixels and are used to specify the distance of the window from the left
or right and top and bottom edges of the screen, respectively.  Both types
of offsets are measured from the indicated edge of the screen to the corresponding
edge of the window.  The X offset may be specified in the following ways:

<dl>

<dt><i>+XOFF</i> </dt>
<dd>The left edge of the window is to be placed <i>XOFF</i> pixels in from the
left edge of the screen (i.e., the X coordinate of the window's origin will
be  <i>XOFF</i>).  <i>XOFF</i> may be negative, in which case the window's left edge  will
be off the screen. </dd>

<dt><i>-XOFF</i> </dt>
<dd>The right edge of the window is to be placed <i>XOFF</i>
pixels in from the right edge of the screen.  <i>XOFF</i> may be negative, in which
case the  window's right edge will be off the screen. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
The Y offset has similar
meanings: 
<dl>

<dt><i>+YOFF</i> </dt>
<dd>The top edge of the window is to be <i>YOFF</i> pixels below the
top edge of the screen (i.e., the Y coordinate of the window's origin will
be <i>YOFF</i>).  <i>YOFF</i> may be negative, in which case the window's top edge  will
be off the screen. </dd>

<dt><i>-YOFF</i> </dt>
<dd>The bottom edge of the window is to be <i>YOFF</i> pixels
above the bottom edge of the screen.  <i>YOFF</i> may be negative, in which case
 the window's bottom edge will be off the screen. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Offsets must be given as
pairs; in other words, in order to specify either <i>XOFF</i> or <i>YOFF</i> both must
be present.  Windows can be placed in the four corners of the screen using
the following specifications: 
<dl>

<dt><i>+0+0</i> </dt>
<dd>upper left hand corner. </dd>

<dt><i>-0+0</i> </dt>
<dd>upper right
hand corner. </dd>

<dt><i>-0-0</i> </dt>
<dd>lower right hand corner. </dd>

<dt><i>+0-0</i> </dt>
<dd>lower left hand corner. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
In the
following examples, a terminal emulator is placed in roughly the center
of the screen and a load average monitor, mailbox, and clock are placed
in the upper right  hand corner: <p>
<br>
<pre>    xterm -fn 6x10 -geometry 80x24+30+200 &amp;
    xclock -geometry 48x48-0+0 &amp;
    xload -geometry 48x48-96+0 &amp;
    xbiff -geometry 48x48-48+0 &amp;
</pre><p>

<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Window Managers</a></h2>
The layout of windows on the screen is controlled by special
programs called <i>window managers</i>.  Although many window managers will honor
geometry specifications as given, others may choose to ignore them (requiring
the user to explicitly draw the window's region on the screen with the pointer,
for  example). <p>
Since window managers are regular (albeit complex) client
programs, a variety of different user interfaces can be built.  The X.Org
Foundation distribution comes with a window manager named <i>twm</i> which supports
overlapping windows, popup menus, point-and-click or click-to-type input models,
title bars, nice icons (and an icon manager for those who don't like separate
icon windows). <p>
See the user-contributed software in the X.Org Foundation distribution
for other popular window managers. 
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Font Names</a></h2>
Collections of characters for
displaying text and symbols in X are known as <i>fonts</i>.  A font typically contains
images that share a common appearance and look nice together (for example,
a single size, boldness, slant, and character set).  Similarly, collections
of fonts that are based on a common type face (the variations are usually
called roman, bold, italic, bold italic,  oblique, and bold oblique) are
called <i>families</i>.   <p>
Fonts come in various sizes.  The X server supports <i>scalable</i>
fonts, meaning it is possible to create a font of arbitrary size from a
single source for the font.  The server supports scaling from <i>outline</i> fonts
and <i>bitmap</i> fonts.  Scaling from outline fonts usually produces significantly
better results than scaling from bitmap fonts. <p>
An X server can obtain fonts
from individual files stored in directories in the file system, or from
one or more font servers, or from a mixtures of directories and font servers.
The list of places the server looks when trying to find a font is controlled
by its <i>font path</i>.  Although most installations will choose to have the server
start up with all of the commonly used font directories in the font path,
the font path can be changed at any time with the <i>xset</i> program. However,
it is important to remember that the directory names are on the <b>server</b>'s
machine, not on the application's. <p>
Bitmap font files are usually created
by compiling a textual font description into binary form, using <i>bdftopcf</i>.
Font databases are created by running the <i>mkfontdir</i> program in the directory
containing the source or compiled versions of the fonts. Whenever fonts
are added to a directory, <i>mkfontdir</i> should be rerun so that the server
can find the new fonts.  To make the server reread the font database, reset
the font path with the <i>xset</i> program.  For example, to add a font to a private
directory, the following commands could be used: <p>
<br>
<pre>    % cp newfont.pcf ~/myfonts
    % mkfontdir ~/myfonts
    % xset fp rehash 
</pre><p>
The <i>xfontsel</i> and <i>xlsfonts</i> programs can be used to browse through the fonts
available on a server. Font names tend to be fairly long as they contain
all of the information needed to uniquely identify individual fonts.  However,
the X server supports wildcarding of font names, so the full specification
<p>
<br>
<pre>    <i>-adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--10-100-75-75-m-60-iso8859-1</i>
</pre><p>
might be abbreviated as: <p>
<br>
<pre>    <i>-*-courier-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1</i>
</pre><p>
Because the shell also has special meanings for <i>*</i> and <i>?</i>, wildcarded font
names should be quoted: <p>
<br>
<pre>    % xlsfonts -fn '-*-courier-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*'
</pre><p>
The <i>xlsfonts</i> program can be used to list all of the fonts that match a
given pattern.  With no arguments, it lists all available fonts. This will
usually list the same font at many different sizes.  To see just the base
scalable font names, try using one of the following patterns: <p>
<br>
<pre>    <i>-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-0-0-*-0-*-*</i>
    <i>-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-75-75-*-0-*-*</i>
    <i>-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-100-100-*-0-*-*</i>
</pre><p>
To convert one of the resulting names into a font at a specific size, replace
one of the first two zeros with a nonzero value. The field containing the
first zero is for the pixel size; replace it with a specific height in
pixels to name a font at that size. Alternatively, the field containing
the second zero is for the point size; replace it with a specific size
in decipoints (there are 722.7 decipoints to the inch) to name a font at
that size. The last zero is an average width field, measured in tenths of
pixels; some servers will anamorphically scale if this value is specified.

<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Font Server Names</a></h2>
One of the following forms can be used to name a font
server that accepts TCP connections: <p>
<br>
<pre>    tcp/<i>hostname</i>:<i>port</i>
    tcp/<i>hostname</i>:<i>port</i>/<i>cataloguelist</i>
</pre><p>
The <i>hostname</i> specifies the name (or decimal numeric address) of the machine
on which the font server is running.  The <i>port</i> is the decimal TCP port on
which the font server is listening for connections. The <i>cataloguelist</i> specifies
a list of catalogue names, with '+' as a separator. <p>
Examples: <i>tcp/x.org:7100</i>,
<i>tcp/198.112.45.11:7100/all</i>. <p>
One of the following forms can be used to name
a font server that accepts DECnet connections: <p>
<br>
<pre>    decnet/<i>nodename</i>::font$<i>objname</i>
    decnet/<i>nodename</i>::font$<i>objname</i>/<i>cataloguelist</i>
</pre><p>
The <i>nodename</i> specifies the name (or decimal numeric address) of the machine
on which the font server is running. The <i>objname</i> is a normal, case-insensitive
DECnet object name. The <i>cataloguelist</i> specifies a list of catalogue names,
with '+' as a separator. <p>
Examples: <i>DECnet/SRVNOD::FONT$DEFAULT</i>, <i>decnet/44.70::font$special/symbols</i>.

<h2><a name='sect10' href='#toc10'>Color Names</a></h2>
Most applications provide ways of tailoring (usually through
resources or command line arguments) the colors of various elements in
the text and graphics they display. A color can be specified either by an
abstract color name, or by a numerical color specification. The numerical
specification can identify a color in either device-dependent (RGB) or device-independent
terms. Color strings are case-insensitive. <p>
X supports the use of abstract
color names, for example, "red", "blue". A value for this abstract name
is obtained by searching one or more color name databases. <i>Xlib</i> first searches
zero or more client-side databases; the number, location, and content of
these databases is implementation dependent. If the name is not found, the
color is looked up in the X server's database. The text form of this database
is commonly stored in the file <i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt</i>. <p>
A numerical color
specification consists of a color space name and a set of values in the
following syntax: <p>
<br>
<pre>    <i>&lt;color_space_name&gt;</i>:<i>&lt;value&gt;/.../&lt;value&gt;</i>
</pre><p>
An RGB Device specification is identified by the prefix "rgb:" and has
the following syntax: <p>
<br>
<pre>    rgb:<i>&lt;red&gt;/&lt;green&gt;/&lt;blue&gt;</i>
        <i>&lt;red&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;green&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;blue&gt;</i> := <i>h</i> | <i>hh</i> | <i>hhh</i> | <i>hhhh</i>
        <i>h</i> := single hexadecimal digits
</pre>Note that <i>h</i> indicates the value scaled in 4 bits,  <i>hh</i> the value scaled
in 8 bits, <i>hhh</i> the value scaled in 12 bits, and <i>hhhh</i> the value scaled in
16 bits, respectively. These values are passed directly to the X server,
and are assumed to be gamma corrected. <p>
The eight primary colors can be represented
as: <p>
<br>
<pre>    black<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;rgb:0/0/0
    red<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;rgb:ffff/0/0
    green<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;rgb:0/ffff/0
    blue<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;rgb:0/0/ffff
    yellow<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;rgb:ffff/ffff/0
    magenta<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;rgb:ffff/0/ffff
    cyan<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;rgb:0/ffff/ffff
    white<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;rgb:ffff/ffff/ffff
</pre><p>
For backward compatibility, an older syntax for RGB Device is supported,
but its continued use is not encouraged. The syntax is an initial sharp
sign character followed by a numeric specification, in one of the following
formats: <p>
<br>
<pre>    #RGB<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;(4 bits each)
    #RRGGBB<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;(8 bits each)
    #RRRGGGBBB<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;(12 bits each)
    #RRRRGGGGBBBB<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;(16 bits each)
</pre><p>
The R, G, and B represent single hexadecimal digits. When fewer than 16
bits each are specified,  they represent the most-significant bits of the
value (unlike the "rgb:" syntax, in which values are scaled). For example,
#3a7 is the same as #3000a0007000. <p>
An RGB intensity specification is identified
by the prefix "rgbi:" and has the following syntax: <p>
<br>
<pre>    rgbi:<i>&lt;red&gt;/&lt;green&gt;/&lt;blue&gt;</i>
</pre><p>
The red, green, and blue are floating point values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.
They represent linear intensity values, with 1.0 indicating full intensity,
0.5 half intensity, and so on. These values will be gamma corrected by <i>Xlib</i>
before being sent to the X server. The input format for these values is
an optional sign, a string of numbers possibly containing a decimal point,
and an optional exponent field containing an E or e  followed by a possibly
signed integer string. <p>
The standard device-independent string specifications
have the following syntax: <p>
<br>
<pre>    CIEXYZ:<i>&lt;X&gt;/&lt;Y&gt;/&lt;Z&gt;</i><tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;(<i>none</i>, 1, <i>none</i>)
    CIEuvY:<i>&lt;u&gt;/&lt;v&gt;/&lt;Y&gt;</i><tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;(~.6, ~.6, 1)
    CIExyY:<i>&lt;x&gt;/&lt;y&gt;/&lt;Y&gt;</i><tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;(~.75, ~.85, 1)
    CIELab:<i>&lt;L&gt;/&lt;a&gt;/&lt;b&gt;</i><tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;(100, <i>none</i>, <i>none</i>)
    CIELuv:<i>&lt;L&gt;/&lt;u&gt;/&lt;v&gt;</i><tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;(100, <i>none</i>, <i>none</i>)
    TekHVC:<i>&lt;H&gt;/&lt;V&gt;/&lt;C&gt;</i><tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;(360, 100, 100)
</pre><p>
All of the values (C, H, V, X, Y, Z, a, b, u, v, y, x) are floating point
values.  Some of the values are constrained to be between zero and some
upper bound; the upper bounds are given in parentheses above. The syntax
for these values is an optional '+' or '-' sign, a string of digits possibly
containing a decimal point, and an optional exponent field consisting of
an 'E' or 'e' followed by an optional '+' or '-' followed by a string of digits.

<h2><a name='sect11' href='#toc11'>Keyboards</a></h2>
<p>
The X keyboard model is broken into two layers:  server-specific
codes (called <i>keycodes</i>) which represent the physical keys, and  server-independent
symbols (called <i>keysyms</i>) which represent the letters or words that appear
on the keys.   Two tables are kept in the server for converting keycodes
to keysyms: 
<dl>

<dt><i>modifier list</i> </dt>
<dd>Some keys (such as Shift, Control, and Caps Lock)
are known as <i>modifier</i> and are used to select different symbols that are
attached to a single key (such as Shift-a generates a capital A, and Control-l
generates a control character ^L).  The server keeps a list of keycodes corresponding
to the various modifier keys.  Whenever a key is pressed or released, the
server  generates an <i>event</i> that contains the keycode of the indicated key
as  well as a mask that specifies which of the modifier keys are currently
pressed. Most servers set up this list to initially contain the various
shift, control, and shift lock keys on the keyboard.   </dd>

<dt><i>keymap table</i> </dt>
<dd>Applications
translate event keycodes and modifier masks into keysyms using a <i>keysym
table</i> which contains one row for each keycode and one column for various
modifier states.  This table is initialized by the server to correspond
to normal typewriter conventions.  The exact semantics of how the table
is interpreted to produce keysyms depends on the particular program, libraries,
and language input method used, but the following conventions for the first
four keysyms in each row are generally adhered to: </dd>
</dl>
<p>
The first four elements
of the list are split into two groups of keysyms. Group 1 contains the first
and second keysyms; Group 2 contains the third and fourth keysyms. Within
each group, if the first element is alphabetic and the the second element
is the special keysym <i>NoSymbol</i>, then the group is treated as equivalent
to a group in which the first element is the lowercase letter and the second
element is the uppercase letter. <p>
Switching between groups is controlled
by the keysym named MODE SWITCH, by attaching that keysym to some key and
attaching that key to any one of the modifiers Mod1 through Mod5. This modifier
is called the ``group modifier.'' Group 1 is used when the group modifier is
off, and Group 2 is used when the group modifier is on. <p>
Within a group,
the modifier state determines which keysym to use. The first keysym is used
when the Shift and Lock modifiers are off. The second keysym is used when
the Shift modifier is on, when the Lock modifier is on and the second keysym
is uppercase alphabetic, or when the Lock modifier is on and is interpreted
as ShiftLock. Otherwise, when the Lock modifier is on and is interpreted
as CapsLock, the state of the Shift modifier is applied first to select
a keysym; but if that keysym is lowercase alphabetic, then the corresponding
uppercase keysym is used instead. 
<h2><a name='sect12' href='#toc12'>Options</a></h2>
Most X programs attempt to use
the same names for command line options and arguments.  All applications
written with the X Toolkit Intrinsics automatically accept the following
options: 
<dl>

<dt><b>-display <i>display</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the name of the X server
to use. </dd>

<dt><b>-geometry <i>geometry</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the initial size and location
of the window. </dd>

<dt><b>-bg <i>color</i>, <b>-background <i>color</i></b></b> </dt>
<dd>Either option specifies the color
to use for the window background. </dd>

<dt><b>-bd <i>color</i>, <b>-bordercolor <i>color</i></b></b> </dt>
<dd>Either option
specifies the color to use for the window border. </dd>

<dt><b>-bw <i>number</i>, <b>-borderwidth
<i>number</i></b></b> </dt>
<dd>Either option specifies the width in pixels of the window border.
</dd>

<dt><b>-fg <i>color</i>, <b>-foreground <i>color</i></b></b> </dt>
<dd>Either option specifies the color to use for
text or graphics. </dd>

<dt><b>-fn <i>font</i>, <b>-font <i>font</i></b></b> </dt>
<dd>Either option specifies the font to
use for displaying text. </dd>

<dt><b>-iconic</b> </dt>
<dd><br>
This option indicates that the user would prefer that the application's
windows initially not be visible as if the windows had be immediately 
iconified by the user.  Window managers may choose not to honor the application's
request.   </dd>

<dt><b>-name</b> </dt>
<dd><br>
This option specifies the name under which resources for the application
should be found.  This option is useful in shell aliases to distinguish
between invocations of an application, without resorting to creating links
to alter the executable file name. </dd>

<dt><b>-rv, <b>-reverse</b></b> </dt>
<dd>Either option indicates that
the program should simulate reverse video if  possible, often by swapping
the foreground and background colors.  Not all programs honor this or implement
it correctly.  It is usually only used on monochrome displays. </dd>

<dt><b>+rv</b> </dt>
<dd><br>
This option indicates that the program should not simulate reverse video.
  This is used to override any defaults since reverse video doesn't always
work properly. </dd>

<dt><b>-selectionTimeout</b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the timeout in milliseconds
within which two communicating applications must respond to one another
for a selection request. </dd>

<dt><b>-synchronous</b> </dt>
<dd>This option indicates that requests
to the X server should be sent  synchronously, instead of asynchronously.
 Since  <i>Xlib</i> normally buffers requests to the server, errors do not necessarily
get reported immediately after they occur.  This option turns off the buffering
so that the application can be debugged.  It should never be used with a
working  program. </dd>

<dt><b>-title <i>string</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies the title to be used
for this window.  This information  is sometimes used by a window manager
to provide some sort of header identifying the window. </dd>

<dt><b>-xnllanguage <i>language[_territory][.codeset]</i></b>
</dt>
<dd>This option specifies the language, territory, and codeset for use in resolving
resource and other filenames. </dd>

<dt><b>-xrm <i>resourcestring</i></b> </dt>
<dd>This option specifies a
resource name and value to override any defaults.  It  is also very useful
for setting resources that don't have explicit command  line arguments. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect13' href='#toc13'>Resources</a></h2>
To
make the tailoring of applications to personal preferences easier, X  provides
a mechanism for storing default values for program resources (e.g. background
color, window title, etc.) Resources are specified as strings that are read
in from various places when an application is run. Program components are
named in a hierarchical fashion, with each node in the hierarchy identified
by a class and an instance name. At the top level is the class and instance
name of the application itself. By convention, the class name of the application
is the same as the program name, but with  the first letter capitalized
(e.g. <i>Bitmap</i> or <i>Emacs</i>) although some programs that begin with the letter
``x'' also capitalize the second letter for historical reasons. <p>
The precise
syntax for resources is: <p>
<br>
<pre>ResourceLine<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec | &lt;empty line&gt;
Comment<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;"!" {&lt;any character except null or newline&gt;}
IncludeFile<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;"#" WhiteSpace "include" WhiteSpace FileName WhiteSpace
FileName<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;&lt;valid filename for operating system&gt;
ResourceSpec<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace ":" WhiteSpace Value
ResourceName<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;[Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName
Binding<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;"." | "*"
WhiteSpace<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;{&lt;space&gt; | &lt;horizontal tab&gt;}
Component<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;"?" | ComponentName
ComponentName<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;NameChar {NameChar}
NameChar<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;"a"-"z" | "A"-"Z" | "0"-"9" | "_" | "-"
Value<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;=<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;{&lt;any character except null or unescaped newline&gt;}
</pre><p>
Elements separated by vertical bar (|) are alternatives. Curly braces ({...})
indicate zero or more repetitions of the enclosed elements. Square brackets
([...]) indicate that the enclosed element is optional. Quotes ("...") are used
around literal characters. <p>
IncludeFile lines are interpreted by replacing
the line with the contents of the specified file.  The word "include" must
be in lowercase. The filename is interpreted relative to the directory of
the file in which the line occurs (for example, if the filename contains
no directory or contains a relative directory specification). <p>
If a ResourceName
contains a contiguous sequence of two or more Binding characters, the sequence
will be replaced with single "." character if the sequence contains only
"." characters, otherwise the sequence will be replaced with a single "*"
character. <p>
A resource database never contains more than one entry for a
given ResourceName.  If a resource file contains multiple lines with the
same ResourceName, the last line in the file is used. <p>
Any whitespace character
before or after the name or colon in a ResourceSpec are ignored. To allow
a Value to begin with whitespace, the two-character sequence ``\<i>space</i>'' (backslash
followed by space) is recognized and replaced by a space character, and
the two-character sequence ``\<i>tab</i>'' (backslash followed by horizontal tab) is
recognized and replaced by a horizontal tab character. To allow a Value
to contain embedded newline characters, the two-character sequence ``\n'' is
recognized and replaced by a newline character. To allow a Value to be broken
across multiple lines in a text file, the two-character sequence ``\<i>newline</i>''
(backslash followed by newline) is recognized and removed from the value.
To allow a Value to contain arbitrary character codes, the four-character
sequence ``\<i>nnn</i>'', where each <i>n</i> is a digit character in the range of ``0''-``7'', is
recognized and replaced with a single byte that contains the octal value
specified by the sequence. Finally, the two-character sequence ``\\'' is recognized
and replaced with a single backslash. <p>
When an application looks for the
value of a resource, it specifies a complete path in the hierarchy, with
both class and instance names. However, resource values are usually given
with only partially specified names and classes, using pattern matching
constructs. An asterisk (*) is a loose binding and is used to represent
any number of intervening components, including none. A period (.) is a tight
binding and is used to separate immediately adjacent components. A question
mark (?) is used to match any single component name or class. A database
entry cannot end in a loose binding; the final component (which cannot
be "?") must be specified. The lookup algorithm searches the resource database
for the entry that most closely matches (is most specific for) the full
name and class being queried. When more than one database entry matches
the full name and class, precedence rules are used to select just one. <p>
The
full name and class are scanned from left to right (from highest level
in the hierarchy to lowest), one component at a time. At each level, the
corresponding component and/or binding of each matching entry is determined,
and these matching components and bindings are compared according to precedence
rules. Each of the rules is applied at each level, before moving to the
next level, until a rule selects a single entry over all others. The rules
(in order of precedence) are: 
<dl>

<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>An entry that contains a matching component
(whether name, class, or "?") takes precedence over entries that elide
the level (that is, entries that match the level in a loose binding). </dd>

<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>An
entry with a matching name takes precedence over both entries with a matching
class and entries that match using "?". An entry with a matching class takes
precedence over entries that match using "?". </dd>

<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>An entry preceded by a tight
binding takes precedence over entries preceded by a loose binding. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Programs
based on the X Tookit Intrinsics obtain resources from the following sources
(other programs usually support some subset of these sources): 
<dl>

<dt><b>RESOURCE_MANAGER
root window property</b> </dt>
<dd>Any global resources that should be available to clients
on all machines  should be stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the
root window of the first screen using the <i>xrdb</i> program. This is frequently
taken care of when the user starts up X through the display manager or
<i>xinit</i>. </dd>

<dt><b>SCREEN_RESOURCES root window property</b> </dt>
<dd>Any resources specific to a
given screen (e.g. colors) that should be available to clients on all machines
 should be stored in the SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of
that screen. The <i>xrdb</i> program will sort resources automatically and place
them in RESOURCE_MANAGER or SCREEN_RESOURCES, as appropriate. </dd>

<dt><b>application-specific
files</b> </dt>
<dd>Directories named by the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH
or the environment variable XAPPLRESDIR (which names a single directory
and should end with a '/' on POSIX systems), plus directories in a standard
place (usually under /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/, but this can be overridden with
the XFILESEARCHPATH environment variable) are searched for for application-specific
resources. For example, application default resources are usually kept in
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/. See the <i>X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language
Interface</i> manual for details. </dd>

<dt><b>XENVIRONMENT</b> </dt>
<dd>Any user- and machine-specific
resources may be specified by setting the XENVIRONMENT environment variable
to the name of a resource file to be loaded by all applications.  If this
variable is not defined, a file named <i>$HOME</i>/.Xdefaults-<i>hostname</i> is looked
for instead, where <i>hostname</i> is the name of the host where the application
is executing. </dd>

<dt><b>-xrm <i>resourcestring</i></b> </dt>
<dd>Resources can also be specified from the
 command line.  The <i>resourcestring</i> is a single resource name and value as
shown above.  Note that if the string contains characters interpreted by
the shell (e.g., asterisk), they must be quoted. Any number of <b>-xrm</b> arguments
may be given on the command line. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Program resources are organized into groups
called <i>classes</i>, so that  collections of individual resources (each of which
are  called <i>instances</i>) can be set all at once.  By convention, the instance
name of a resource begins with a lowercase letter and class name with an
upper case letter. Multiple word resources are concatenated with the first
letter of the  succeeding words capitalized.  Applications written with
the X Toolkit Intrinsics will have at least the following resources: <p>

<dl>

<dt><b>background
(class<b> Background)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>This resource specifies the color to use for the window
background. </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>borderWidth (class<b> BorderWidth)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>This resource specifies the
width in pixels of the window border. </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>borderColor (class<b> BorderColor)</b> </b></dt>
<dd>This
resource specifies the color to use for the window border. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Most applications
using the X Toolkit Intrinsics also have the resource <b>foreground</b> (class
<b>Foreground</b>), specifying the color to use for text and graphics within the
window. <p>
By combining class and instance specifications, application preferences
 can be set quickly and easily.  Users of color displays will frequently
want to set Background and Foreground classes to particular defaults. Specific
color instances such as text cursors can then be overridden without having
to define all of the related resources.  For example, <p>
<br>
<pre>    bitmap*Dashed:  off
    XTerm*cursorColor:  gold
    XTerm*multiScroll:  on
    XTerm*jumpScroll:  on
    XTerm*reverseWrap:  on
    XTerm*curses:  on
    XTerm*Font:  6x10

    XTerm*cutNewline: off
    XTerm*cutToBeginningOfLine: off
    XTerm*titeInhibit:  on
    XTerm*ttyModes:  intr ^c erase ^? kill ^u
    XLoad*Background: gold
    XLoad*Foreground: red
    XLoad*highlight: black
    XLoad*borderWidth: 0
    emacs*Geometry:  80x65-0-0
    emacs*Background:  rgb:5b/76/86
    emacs*Foreground:  white
    emacs*Cursor:  white
    emacs*BorderColor:  white
    emacs*Font:  6x10
    xmag*geometry: -0-0
    xmag*borderColor:  white
</pre><p>
If these resources were stored in a file called <i>.Xresources</i> in your home
directory, they could be added to any existing resources in the server
with the following command: <p>
<br>
<pre>    % xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources
</pre><p>
This is frequently how user-friendly startup scripts merge user-specific
 defaults into any site-wide defaults.  All sites are encouraged to set up
convenient ways of automatically loading resources. See the <i>Xlib</i>  manual
section <i>Resource Manager Functions</i> for more information.

<h2><a name='sect16' href='#toc16'>Diagnostics</a></h2>
A wide variety of error messages are generated from various
programs. The default error handler in <i>Xlib</i> (also used by many toolkits)
uses standard resources to construct diagnostic messages when errors occur.
 The defaults for these messages are usually stored in <i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XErrorDB</i>.
 If this file is not present, error messages will be rather terse and cryptic.
<p>
When the X Toolkit Intrinsics encounter errors converting resource strings
to the appropriate internal format, no error messages are usually printed.
 This is convenient when it is desirable to have one set of resources across
a variety of displays (e.g. color vs. monochrome, lots of fonts vs. very few,
etc.), although it can pose problems for trying to determine why an application
might be failing.  This behavior can be overridden by the setting the <i>StringConversionsWarning</i>
resource. <p>
To force the X Toolkit Intrinsics to always print string conversion
error messages, the following resource should be placed in the file that
gets loaded onto the RESOURCE_MANAGER property using the <i>xrdb</i> program (frequently
called <i>.Xresources</i> or <i>.Xres</i> in the user's home directory): <p>
<br>
<pre>    *StringConversionWarnings: on
</pre><p>
To have conversion messages printed for just a particular application,
the appropriate instance name can be placed before the asterisk: <p>
<br>
<pre>    xterm*StringConversionWarnings: on
</pre>
