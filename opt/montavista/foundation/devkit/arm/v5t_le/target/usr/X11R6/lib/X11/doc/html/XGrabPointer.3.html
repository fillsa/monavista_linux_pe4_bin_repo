<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The
<i>XGrabPointer</i>   function actively grabs control of the pointer and returns
<i>GrabSuccess</i>   if the grab was successful. Further pointer events are reported
only to the grabbing client. <i>XGrabPointer</i>   overrides any active pointer
grab by this client. If owner_events is  <i>False</i>,   all generated pointer
events are reported with respect to grab_window and are reported only if
selected by event_mask. If owner_events is  <i>True</i>   and if a generated pointer
event would normally be reported to this client,  it is reported as usual.
 Otherwise, the event is reported with respect to the grab_window and is
reported only if selected by event_mask. For either value of owner_events,
unreported events are discarded. <p>
If the pointer_mode is  <i>GrabModeAsync</i>,
  pointer event processing continues as usual. If the pointer is currently
frozen by this client,  the processing of events for the pointer is resumed.
If the pointer_mode is  <i>GrabModeSync</i>,   the state of the pointer, as seen
by client applications, appears to freeze, and the X server generates no
further pointer events until the grabbing client calls  <i>XAllowEvents</i>  
or until the pointer grab is released. Actual pointer changes are not lost
while the pointer is frozen; they are simply queued in the server for later
processing. <p>
If the keyboard_mode is  <i>GrabModeAsync</i>,   keyboard event processing
is unaffected by activation of the grab. If the keyboard_mode is  <i>GrabModeSync</i>,
  the state of the keyboard, as seen by client applications, appears to
freeze, and the X server generates no further keyboard events until the
grabbing client calls  <i>XAllowEvents</i>   or until the pointer grab is released.
Actual keyboard changes are not lost while the pointer is frozen; they
are simply queued in the server for later processing. <p>
If a cursor is specified,
it is displayed regardless of what window the pointer is in.   If  <i>None</i>
  is specified, the normal cursor for that window is displayed when the
pointer is in grab_window or one of its subwindows; otherwise, the cursor
for grab_window is displayed. <p>
If a confine_to window is specified, the pointer
is restricted to stay contained in that window. The confine_to window need
have no relationship to the grab_window. If the pointer is not initially
in the confine_to window,  it is warped automatically to the closest edge
 just before the grab activates and enter/leave events are generated as
usual.  If the confine_to window is subsequently reconfigured,  the pointer
is warped automatically, as necessary,  to keep it contained in the window.
<p>
The time argument allows you to avoid certain circumstances that come up
if applications take a long time to respond or if there are long network
delays. Consider a situation where you have two applications, both of which
normally grab the pointer when clicked on. If both applications specify
the timestamp from the event,  the second application may wake up faster
and successfully grab the pointer before the first application.  The first
application then will get an indication that the other application  grabbed
the pointer before its request was processed. <p>
<i>XGrabPointer</i>   generates <i>EnterNotify</i>
  and <i>LeaveNotify</i>   events. <p>
Either if grab_window or confine_to window is
not viewable or if the confine_to window lies completely outside the boundaries
of the root window, <i>XGrabPointer</i>   fails and returns <i>GrabNotViewable</i>.  
If the pointer is actively grabbed by some other client, it fails and returns
<i>AlreadyGrabbed</i>.   If the pointer is frozen by an active grab of another
client, it fails and returns <i>GrabFrozen</i>.   If the specified time is earlier
than the last-pointer-grab time or later  than the current X server time,
it fails and returns <i>GrabInvalidTime</i>.   Otherwise, the last-pointer-grab time
is set to the specified time (<i>CurrentTime</i>   is replaced by the current
X server time). <p>
<i>XGrabPointer</i>   can generate <i>BadCursor</i>,   <i>BadValue</i>,   and
<i>BadWindow</i>   errors. <p>
The <i>XUngrabPointer</i>   function releases the pointer and
any queued events if this client has actively grabbed the pointer from
<i>XGrabPointer</i>,   <i>XGrabButton</i>,   or from a normal button press. <i>XUngrabPointer</i>
  does not release the pointer if the specified time is earlier than the
last-pointer-grab time or is later than the current X server time. It also
generates  <i>EnterNotify</i>   and  <i>LeaveNotify</i>   events. The X server performs
an  <i>UngrabPointer</i>   request automatically if the event window or confine_to
window  for an active pointer grab becomes not viewable or if window reconfiguration
causes the confine_to window to lie completely outside the boundaries of
the root window. <p>
The <i>XChangeActivePointerGrab</i>   function changes the specified
dynamic parameters if the pointer is actively grabbed by the client and
if the specified time is no earlier than the last-pointer-grab time and no
later than the current X server time. This function has no effect on the
passive parameters of a <i>XGrabButton</i>.   The interpretation of event_mask
and cursor is the same as described in <i>XGrabPointer</i>.   <p>
<i>XChangeActivePointerGrab</i>
  can generate a <i>BadCursor</i>   and <i>BadValue</i>   error. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Diagnostics</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><i>BadCursor</i>
</dt>
<dd>  A value for a Cursor argument does not name a defined Cursor. </dd>

<dt><i>BadValue</i>
</dt>
<dd>  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full
range defined by the argument's type is accepted.  Any argument defined as
a set of alternatives can generate this error. </dd>

<dt><i>BadWindow</i> </dt>
<dd>  A value for a
Window argument does not name a defined Window. </dd>
