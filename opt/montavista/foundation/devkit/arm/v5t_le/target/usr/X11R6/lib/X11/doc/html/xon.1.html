<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
xon - start an X program on a remote machine

<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>xon</b> remote-host [-access] [-debug] [-name window-name] [-nols] [-screen
screen-no] [-user user-name] [command ...] 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<i>Xon</i> runs the specified
command (default xterm -ls) on the remote machine using rsh, remsh, or rcmd.
 Xon passes the DISPLAY, XAUTHORITY and XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment
variables to the remote command. <p>
When no command is specified, xon runs
'xterm -ls'.  It additionally specifies the application name to be 'xterm-<i>remote-host</i>'
and the window title to be '-fIremote-host'. <p>
Xon can only work when the remote
host will allow you to log in without a password, by having an entry in
the .rhosts file permitting access. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>
<p>
Note that the options follow the
remote host name (as they do with rlogin). <p>

<dl>

<dt><b>-access</b></dt>
<dd>Runs xhost locally to add
the remote host to the host access list in the X server.  This won't work
unless xhost is given permission to modify the access list. </dd>

<dt><b>-debug</b></dt>
<dd>Normally,
xon disconnects the remote process from stdin, stdout and stderr to eliminate
the daemon processes which usually connect them across the network.  Specifying
the <b>-debug</b> option leaves them connected so that error messages from the
remote execution are sent back to the originating host. </dd>

<dt><b>-name window-name</b></dt>
<dd>This
specifies a different application name and window title for the default
command (xterm). </dd>

<dt><b>-nols</b></dt>
<dd>Normally xon passes the -ls option to the remote xterm;
this option suspends that behaviour. </dd>

<dt><b>-screen screen-no</b></dt>
<dd>This changes the screen
number of the DISPLAY variable passed to the remote command. </dd>

<dt><b>-user user-name</b></dt>
<dd>By
default, xon simply uses rsh/remsh/rcmd to connect to the remote machine
using the same user name as on the local machine.  This option cause xon
to specify an alternative user name.  This will not work unless you have
authorization to access the remote account, by placing an appropriate entry
in the remote users .rhosts file. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Bugs</a></h2>
Xon can get easily confused when the
remote-host, user-name or various environment variable values contain white
space. <p>
Xon has no way to send the appropriate X authorization information
to the remote host. <p>
