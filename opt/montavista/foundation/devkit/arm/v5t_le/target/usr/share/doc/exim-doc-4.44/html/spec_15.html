15. Generic options for routers
</a></h1>
<p>
This chapter describes the generic options that apply to all routers, 
identifying those that are preconditions. For a general description of how a
router operates, see sections <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.10">3.10</a> and <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a>. The second
of these sections specifies the order in which the preconditions are tested.
The order of expansion of the options that provide data for a transport is: 
<tt>errors&#095;to</tt>, <tt>headers&#095;add</tt>, <tt>headers&#095;remove</tt>, <tt>transport</tt>.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1522"></a>
<a name="IX1523"></a>
<h3>address_data</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
The string is expanded just before the router is run, that is, after all the
precondition tests have succeeded. If the expansion is forced to fail, the
router declines. Other expansion failures cause delivery of the address to be
deferred.
</p>
<p>
When the expansion succeeds, the value is retained with the address, and can be
accessed using the variable <tt>$address&#095;data</tt> in the current router, subsequent
routers, and the eventual transport. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning</b>: if the current or any subsequent router is a <b>redirect</b> router 
that runs a user's filter file, the contents of <tt>$address&#095;data</tt> are
accessible in the filter. This is not normally a problem, because such data is
usually either not confidential or it &#147;belongs&#148; to the current user, but if you 
do put confidential data into <tt>$address&#095;data</tt> you need to remember this 
point.
</p>
<p>
Even if the router declines or passes, the value of <tt>$address&#095;data</tt> remains
with the address, though it can be changed by another <tt>address&#095;data</tt> setting
on a subsequent router. If a router generates child addresses, the value of
<tt>$address&#095;data</tt> propagates to them. This also applies to the special kind of
&#147;child&#148; that is generated by a router with the <tt>unseen</tt> option.
</p>
<p>
The idea of <tt>address&#095;data</tt> is that you can use it to look up a lot of data for
the address once, and then pick out parts of the data later. For example, you
could use a single LDAP lookup to return a string of the form
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;uid=1234 gid=5678 mailbox=/mail/xyz forward=/home/xyz/.forward
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In the transport you could pick out the mailbox by a setting such as
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;file = ${extract{mailbox}{$address_data}}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This makes the configuration file less messy, and also reduces the number of
lookups. (Exim does cache the most recent lookup, but there may be several
addresses in a message which cause lookups to occur.)
</p>
<p>
The <tt>address&#095;data</tt> facility is also useful as a means of passing information 
from one router to another,
and from a router to a transport. In addition, if <tt>address&#095;data</tt> is set by a 
router when verifying an address from an ACL, its value is available for use in 
the rest of the ACL statement.

<h3>address_test</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; true<br>
<p>
If this option is set false, the router is skipped when routing is being tested
by means of the <i>-bt</i> command line option. This can be a convenience when your
first router sends messages to an external scanner, because it saves you 
having to set the &#147;already scanned&#148; indicator when testing real address 
routing.

<a name="IX1529"></a>
<h3>cannot_route_message</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
This option specifies a text message that is used when an address cannot be
routed because Exim has run out of routers. The default message is &#147;Unrouteable
address&#148;. This option is useful only on routers that have <tt>more</tt> set false, or
on the very last router in a configuration, because the value that is used is
taken from the last router that inspects an address. For example, using the
default configuration, you could put:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot_route_message = Remote domain not found in DNS
</pre>
</p>
<p>
on the first (<b>dnslookup</b>) router, and
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot_route_message = Unknown local user
</pre>
</p>
<p>
on the final router that checks for local users. If string expansion fails, the 
default message is used.
Unless the expansion failure was explicitly forced, a message about the failure
is written to the main and panic logs, in addition to the normal message about
the routing failure.

<a name="IX1532"></a>
<h3>caseful_local_part</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; false<br>
<p>
By default, routers handle the local parts of addresses in a case-insensitive
manner, though the actual case is preserved for transmission with the message.
If you want the case of letters to be significant in a router, you must set
this option true. For individual router options that contain address or local
part lists (for example, <tt>local&#095;parts</tt>), case-sensitive matching can be turned
on by &#147;+caseful&#148; as a list item. See section <a href="spec_10.html#SECT10.19">10.19</a> for more details.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1533"></a>
<a name="IX1534"></a>
<a name="IX1535"></a>
<h3>check_local_user</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; false<br>
<p>
When this option is true, Exim checks that the local part of the recipient
address (with affixes removed if relevant) is the name of an account on the
local system. The check is done by calling the <i>getpwnam()</i> function rather
than trying to read <i>/etc/passwd</i> directly. This means that other methods of
holding password data (such as NIS) are supported. If the local part is a local
user, <tt>$home</tt> is set from the password data, and can be tested in other
preconditions that are evaluated after this one 
(the order of evaluation is given in section <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a>). However, the
value of <tt>$home</tt> can be overridden by <tt>router&#095;home&#095;directory</tt>.
If the local part is not a local user, the router is skipped.
</p>
<p>
If you want to check that the local part is either the name of a local user
or matches something else, you cannot combine <tt>check&#095;local&#095;user</tt> with a 
setting of <tt>local&#095;parts</tt>, because that specifies the logical <i>and</i> of the 
two conditions. However, you can use a <b>passwd</b> lookup in a <tt>local&#095;parts</tt> 
setting to achieve this. For example:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;local_parts = passwd;$local_part : lsearch;/etc/other/users
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Note, however, that the side effects of <tt>check&#095;local&#095;user</tt> (such as setting
up a home directory) do not occur when a <b>passwd</b> lookup is used in a
<tt>local&#095;parts</tt> (or any other) precondition.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1536"></a>
<a name="IX1537"></a>
<h3>condition</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
This option specifies a general precondition test that has to succeed for the
router to be called. The string is expanded, and if the result is a forced
failure or an empty string or one of the strings &#147;0&#148; or &#147;no&#148; or &#147;false&#148;
(checked without regard to the case of the letters), the router is skipped, and
the address is offered to the next one. This provides a means of applying
special-purpose conditions to the running of routers.
</p>
<p>
If the expansion fails (other than forced failure) delivery is deferred. Some
of the other options below are common special cases that could in fact be
specified using <tt>condition</tt>.
Note that <tt>condition</tt> is the last precondition to be evaluated (see
section <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a>). 
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1538"></a>
<a name="IX1539"></a>
<h3>debug_print</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
If this option is set and debugging is enabled (see the <i>-d</i> command line
option), the string is expanded and included in the debugging output. 
If expansion of the string fails, the error message is written to the debugging 
output, and Exim carries on processing.
This option is provided to help with checking out the values of variables and
so on when debugging router configurations. For example, if a <tt>condition</tt>
option appears not to be working, <tt>debug&#095;print</tt> can be used to output the
variables it references. The output happens after checks for <tt>domains</tt>,
<tt>local&#095;parts</tt>, and <tt>check&#095;local&#095;user</tt> but before any other preconditions are
tested. A newline is added to the text if it does not end with one.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1540"></a>
<h3>disable_logging</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; false<br>
<p>
If this option is set true, nothing is logged for any routing errors
<font color=green>
or for any deliveries caused by this router. You should not set this option
unless you really, really know what you are doing. See also the generic
transport option of the same name.
</font>
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1541"></a>
<a name="IX1542"></a>
<h3>domains</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; domain list, expanded (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
If this option is set, the router is skipped unless the current domain matches
the list. If the match is achieved by means of a file lookup, the data that the
lookup returned for the domain is placed in <tt>$domain&#095;data</tt> for use in string
expansions of the driver's private options.
See section <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a> for a list of the order in which preconditions 
are evaluated.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1543"></a>
<h3>driver</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
This option must always be set. It specifies which of the available routers is
to be used.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1544"></a>
<a name="IX1545"></a>
<a name="IX1546"></a>
<h3>errors_to</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
If a router successfully handles an address, it may queue the address for
delivery or it may generate child addresses. In both cases, if there is a
delivery problem during later processing, the resulting bounce message is sent
to the address that results from expanding this string, provided that the
address verifies successfully. 
<tt>errors&#095;to</tt> is expanded before <tt>headers&#095;add</tt>, <tt>headers&#095;remove</tt>, and 
<tt>transport</tt>.
</p>
<p>
If the option is unset, or the expansion is forced to fail, or the result of
the expansion fails to verify, the errors address associated with the incoming
address is used. At top level, this is the envelope sender. A non-forced
expansion failure causes delivery to be deferred.
</p>
<p>
If an address for which <tt>errors&#095;to</tt> has been set ends up being delivered over
SMTP, the envelope sender for that delivery is the <tt>errors&#095;to</tt> value, so that
any bounces that are generated by other MTAs on the delivery route are also
sent there. The most common use of <tt>errors&#095;to</tt> is probably to direct mailing
list bounces to the manager of the list, as described in section
<a href="spec_42.html#SECT42.2">42.2</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>errors&#095;to</tt> setting associated with an address can be overridden if it
subsequently passes through other routers that have their own <tt>errors&#095;to</tt>
settings,
or if it is delivered by a transport with a <tt>return&#095;path</tt> setting.
</p>
<p>
You can set <tt>errors&#095;to</tt> to the empty string by either of these settings:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;errors_to =
&nbsp;&nbsp;errors_to = ""
</pre>
</p>
<p>
An expansion item that yields an empty string has the same effect. If you do
this, a locally detected delivery error for addresses processed by this router
no longer gives rise to a bounce message; the error is discarded. If the
address is delivered to a remote host, the return path is set to <tt>&#060;&#062;</tt>, unless
overridden by the <tt>return&#095;path</tt> option on the transport.
</p>
<p>
If for some reason you want to discard local errors, but use a non-empty
<font size=-1>MAIL</font> command for remote delivery, you can preserve the original return
path in <tt>$address&#095;data</tt> in the router, and reinstate it in the transport by
setting <tt>return&#095;path</tt>.

<a name="IX1551"></a>
<h3>expn</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; true<br>
<p>
If this option is turned off, the router is skipped when testing an address
as a result of processing an SMTP <font size=-1>EXPN</font> command. You might, for example,
want to turn it off on a router for users' <i>.forward</i> files, while leaving it
on for the system alias file. 
See section <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a> for a list of the order in which preconditions 
are evaluated.
</p>
<p>
The use of the SMTP <font size=-1>EXPN</font> command is controlled by an ACL (see chapter
<a href="spec_38.html">38</a>). When Exim is running an <font size=-1>EXPN</font> command, it is similar to testing
an address with <i>-bt</i>. Compare <font size=-1>VRFY</font>, whose counterpart is <i>-bv</i>.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1552"></a>
<a name="IX1553"></a>
<h3>fail_verify</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; false<br>
<p>
Setting this option has the effect of setting both <tt>fail&#095;verify&#095;sender</tt> and
<tt>fail&#095;verify&#095;recipient</tt> to the same value.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1554"></a>
<h3>fail_verify_recipient</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; false<br>
<p>
If this option is true and an address is accepted by this router when
verifying a recipient, verification fails.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1555"></a>
<h3>fail_verify_sender</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; false<br>
<p>
If this option is true and an address is accepted by this router when
verifying a sender, verification fails.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1556"></a>
<a name="IX1557"></a>
<a name="IX1558"></a>
<h3>fallback_hosts</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string list<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
String expansion is not applied to this option. The argument must be a
colon-separated list of host names or IP addresses. If a router queues an
address for a remote transport, this host list is associated with the address,
and used instead of the transport's fallback host list. If <tt>hosts&#095;randomize</tt>
is set on the transport, the order of the list is randomized for each use. See
the <tt>fallback&#095;hosts</tt> option of the <b>smtp</b> transport for further details.

<a name="IX1560"></a>
<a name="IX1561"></a>
<a name="IX1562"></a>
<a name="IX1563"></a>
<h3>group</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; see below<br>
<p>
When a router queues an address for a transport, and the transport does not
specify a group, the group given here is used when running the delivery
process. 
The group may be specified numerically or by name. If expansion fails, the 
error is logged and delivery is deferred.
The default is unset, unless <tt>check&#095;local&#095;user</tt> is set, when the default
is taken from the password information. See also <tt>initgroups</tt> and <tt>user</tt> and
the discussion in chapter <a href="spec_23.html">23</a>.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1564"></a>
<a name="IX1565"></a>
<a name="IX1566"></a>
<h3>headers_add</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
This option specifies a string of text that is expanded at routing time, and
associated with any addresses that are processed by the router
when delivering a message. This option has no effect when an address is just
being verified.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>headers&#095;add</tt> option is expanded after <tt>errors&#095;to</tt>, but before
<tt>headers&#095;remove</tt> and <tt>transport</tt>.
If the expanded string is empty, or if the expansion is forced to fail, the
option has no effect. Other expansion failures are treated as configuration
errors. The expanded string must be in the form of one or more RFC 2822 header
lines, separated by newlines (coded as &#147;&#092;n&#148;). For example:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;headers_add = X-added-header: added by $primary_hostname\n\
&nbsp;&nbsp;              X-added-second: another added header line
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Exim does not check the syntax of these added header lines. If an address
passes through several routers as a result of aliasing or forwarding
operations, any <tt>headers&#095;add</tt> or <tt>headers&#095;remove</tt> specifications are
cumulative. This does not apply for multiple routers that result from the use
of &#147;unseen&#148;.
</p>
<p>
At transport time, all the original headers listed in <tt>headers_remove</tt> are
removed. If there are multiple instances of any listed header, they are all
removed.
Then the new headers specified by <tt>headers&#095;add</tt> are added, in the order in
which they were attached to the address. Finally, any additional headers
specified by the transport are added. It is not possible to remove headers
added to an address by <tt>headers&#095;add</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Because the addition does not happen until transport time, header lines that
are added by <tt>headers&#095;add</tt> are not accessible by means of the <tt>$header&#095;xxx</tt>
expansion syntax. Conversely, header lines that are removed by
<tt>headers&#095;remove</tt> remain visible.
</p>
<p>
Addresses with different <tt>headers&#095;add</tt> or <tt>headers&#095;remove</tt> settings cannot be
delivered together in a batch. The <tt>headers&#095;add</tt> option cannot be used for a
<b>redirect</b> router that has the <tt>one&#095;time</tt> option set.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1567"></a>
<a name="IX1568"></a>
<a name="IX1569"></a>
<h3>headers_remove</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
The string is expanded at routing time and is then associated with any
addresses that are processed by the router when delivering a message. This
option has no effect when an address is being verified. The <tt>headers&#095;remove</tt>
option is expanded after <tt>errors&#095;to</tt> and <tt>headers&#095;add</tt>, but before
<tt>transport</tt>. If the expansion is forced to fail, the option has no effect.
Other expansion failures are treated as configuration errors. 
</p>
<p>
<font color=green>
After expansion, the string must consist of a colon-separated list of header
names. This is confusing, because header names themselves are often terminated
by colons. In this case, the colons are the list separators, not part of the
names.
</font>
For example:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;headers_remove = return-receipt-to:acknowledge-to
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The list is used at transport time as described under <tt>headers&#095;add</tt> above. The
<tt>headers&#095;remove</tt> option cannot be used for a <b>redirect</b> router that has the
<tt>one&#095;time</tt> option set.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1570"></a>
<a name="IX1571"></a>
<a name="IX1572"></a>
<h3>ignore_target_hosts</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; host list, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
Although this option is a host list, it should normally contain IP address
entries rather than names. If any host that is looked up by the router has an
IP address that matches an item in this list, Exim behaves as if that IP
address did not exist. This option allows you to cope with rogue DNS entries
like
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;remote.domain.example.  A  127.0.0.1
</pre>
</p>
<p>
by setting
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore_target_hosts = 127.0.0.1
</pre>
</p>
<p>
on the relevant router. 
<font color=green>
If all the hosts found by a <b>dnslookup</b> router are discarded in this way, the
router declines. In a conventional configuration, an attempt to mail to such a
domain would then normally provoke the &#147;unrouteable domain&#148; error, and an
attempt to verify an address in the domain would fail.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if <tt>ignore&#095;target&#095;hosts</tt> is set on an <b>ipliteral</b> router, the
router declines if presented with one of the listed addresses.
</font>
</p>
<p>
This option may also be useful for ignoring link-local and site-local IPv6
addresses. Because, like all host lists, the value of <tt>ignore&#095;target&#095;hosts</tt>
is expanded before use as a list, it is possible to make it dependent on the
domain that is being routed.

<hr></p>
<a name="IX1577"></a>
<h3>initgroups</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; false<br>
<p>
If the router queues an address for a transport, and this option is true, and
the uid supplied by the router is not overridden by the transport, the
<i>initgroups()</i> function is called when running the transport to ensure that
any additional groups associated with the uid are set up. See also <tt>group</tt> and
<tt>user</tt> and the discussion in chapter <a href="spec_23.html">23</a>.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1578"></a>
<a name="IX1579"></a>
<a name="IX1580"></a>
<h3>local_part_prefix</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string list (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
If this option is set, the router is skipped unless the local part
starts with one of the given strings, or <tt>local&#095;part&#095;prefix&#095;optional</tt> is
true.
See section <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a> for a list of the order in which preconditions
are evaluated.
</p>
<p>
<a name="IX1581"></a>
<a name="IX1582"></a>
The list is scanned from left to right, and the first prefix that matches is
used. A limited form of wildcard is available; if the prefix begins with an
asterisk, it matches the longest possible sequence of arbitrary characters at
the start of the local part. An asterisk should therefore always be followed by
some character that does not occur in normal local parts.
Wildcarding can be used to set up multiple user mailboxes, as described in
section <a href="spec_42.html#SECT42.7">42.7</a>.
</p>
<p>
During the testing of the <tt>local&#095;parts</tt> option, and while the router is
running, the prefix is removed from the local part, and is available in the
expansion variable <tt>$local&#095;part&#095;prefix</tt>. If the router accepts the address,
this remains true during subsequent delivery.
In particular, the local part that is transmitted in the <font size=-1>RCPT</font> command 
for LMTP, SMTP, and BSMTP deliveries has the prefix removed by default. This 
behaviour can be overridden by setting <tt>rcpt&#095;include&#095;affixes</tt> true on the 
relevant transport.
</p>
<p>
The prefix facility is commonly used to handle local parts of the form
<tt>owner-something</tt>. Another common use is to support local parts of the form
<tt>real-username</tt> to bypass a user's <i>.forward</i> file &#150; helpful when trying to
tell a user their forwarding is broken &#150; by placing a router like this one
immediately before the router that handles <i>.forward</i> files:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;real_localuser:
&nbsp;&nbsp;  driver = accept
&nbsp;&nbsp;  local_part_prefix = real-
&nbsp;&nbsp;  check_local_user
&nbsp;&nbsp;  transport = local_delivery
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If both <tt>local&#095;part&#095;prefix</tt> and <tt>local&#095;part&#095;suffix</tt> are set for a router,
both conditions must be met if not optional. Care must be taken if wildcards
are used in both a prefix and a suffix on the same router. Different
separator characters must be used to avoid ambiguity.

<a name="IX1586"></a>
<h3>local_part_suffix</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string list (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
This option operates in the same way as <tt>local&#095;part&#095;prefix</tt>, except that the
local part must end (rather than start) with the given string, the
<tt>local&#095;part&#095;suffix&#095;optional</tt> option determines whether the suffix is
mandatory, and the wildcard * character, if present, must be the last
character of the suffix. This option facility is commonly used to handle local
parts of the form <tt>something-request</tt> and multiple user mailboxes of the form
<tt>username-foo</tt>.

<h3>local_part_suffix_optional</h3>

<h3>local_parts</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; local part list, expanded (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
The router is run only if the local part of the address matches the list.
See section <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a> for a list of the order in which preconditions 
are evaluated, and
section <a href="spec_10.html#SECT10.20">10.20</a> for a discussion of local part lists. Because the
string is expanded, it is possible to make it depend on the domain, for
example:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;local_parts = dbm;/usr/local/specials/$domain
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If the match is achieved by a lookup, the data that the lookup returned
for the local part is placed in the variable <tt>$local&#095;part&#095;data</tt> for use in
expansions of the router's private options. You might use this option, for
example, if you have a large number of local virtual domains, and you want to
send all postmaster mail to the same place without having to set up an alias in
each virtual domain:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;postmaster:
&nbsp;&nbsp;  driver = redirect
&nbsp;&nbsp;  local_parts = postmaster
&nbsp;&nbsp;  data = postmaster@real.domain.example
</pre>
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1591"></a>
<a name="IX1592"></a>
<a name="IX1593"></a>
<h3>log_as_local</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; see below<br>
<p>
Exim has two logging styles for delivery, the idea being to make local
deliveries stand out more visibly from remote ones. In the &#147;local&#148; style, the
recipient address is given just as the local part, without a domain. The use of
this style is controlled by this option. It defaults to true for the <b>accept</b>
router, and false for all the others.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1594"></a>
<h3>more</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; true<br>
<p>
The result of string expansion for this option must be a valid boolean value,
that is, one of the strings &#147;yes&#148;, &#147;no&#148;, &#147;true&#148;, or &#147;false&#148;. Any other result
causes an error, and delivery is deferred. If the expansion is forced to fail,
the default value for the option (true) is used. Other failures cause delivery
to be deferred.
</p>
<p>
<a name="IX1595"></a>
If this option is set false, and the router is run, but declines to handle the
address, no further routers are tried, routing fails, and the address is
bounced.
However, if the router explicitly passes an address to the following router by
means of the setting
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;self = pass
</pre>
</p>
<p>
or otherwise, the setting of <tt>more</tt> is ignored. Also, the setting of <tt>more</tt>
does not affect the behaviour if one of the precondition tests fails. In that
case, the address is always passed to the next router.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1596"></a>
<a name="IX1597"></a>
<a name="IX1598"></a>
<h3>pass_on_timeout</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; false<br>
<p>
If a router times out during a host lookup, it normally causes deferral of the
address. If <tt>pass&#095;on&#095;timeout</tt> is set, the address is passed on to the next
router, overriding <tt>no&#095;more</tt>. This may be helpful for systems that are
intermittently connected to the Internet, or those that want to pass to a smart
host any messages that cannot immediately be delivered.
</p>
<p>
There are occasional other temporary errors that can occur while doing DNS
lookups. They are treated in the same way as a timeout, and this option
applies to all of them.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1599"></a>
<a name="IX1600"></a>
<h3>pass_router</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
When a router returns &#147;pass&#148;, the address is normally handed on to the next
router in sequence. This can be changed by setting <tt>pass&#095;router</tt> to the name
of another router. However (unlike <tt>redirect&#095;router</tt>) the named router must be
below the current router, to avoid loops. Note that this option applies only to
the special case of &#147;pass&#148;. It does not apply when a router returns &#147;decline&#148;.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1601"></a>
<a name="IX1602"></a>
<h3>redirect_router</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
Sometimes an administrator knows that it is pointless to reprocess addresses
generated from alias or forward files with the same router again. For
example, if an alias file translates real names into login ids there is no
point searching the alias file a second time, especially if it is a large file.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>redirect&#095;router</tt> option can be set to the name of any router instance. It
causes the routing of any generated addresses to start at the named router
instead of at the first router. This option has no effect if the router in
which it is set does not generate new addresses.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1603"></a>
<a name="IX1604"></a>
<a name="IX1605"></a>
<h3>require_files</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string list, expanded (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
This option provides a general mechanism for predicating the running of a
router on the existence or non-existence of certain files or directories.
Before running a router, as one of its precondition tests, Exim works its way
through the <tt>require&#095;files</tt> list, expanding each item separately. 
</p>
<p>
Because the list is split before expansion, any colons in expansion items must
be doubled, or the facility for using a different list separator must be used.
If any expansion is forced to fail, the item is ignored. Other expansion 
failures cause routing of the address to be deferred.
</p>
<p>
If any expanded string is empty, it is ignored. Otherwise, except as described
below, each string must be a fully qualified file path, optionally preceded by
&#147;!&#148;. The paths are passed to the <i>stat()</i> function to test for the existence
of the files or directories. The router is skipped if any paths not preceded by
&#147;!&#148; do not exist, or if any paths preceded by &#147;!&#148; do exist.
<a name="IX1606"></a>
</p>
<p>
If <i>stat()</i> cannot determine whether a file exists or not, delivery of
the message is deferred. This can happen when NFS-mounted filesystems are
unavailable.
</p>
<p>
This option is checked after the <tt>domains</tt>, <tt>local&#095;parts</tt>, and <tt>senders</tt>
options, so you cannot use it to check for the existence of a file in which to
look up a domain, local part, or sender. (See section <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a> for a
full list of the order in which preconditions are evaluated.) However, as
these options are all expanded, you can use the <tt>exists</tt> expansion condition to
make such tests. The <tt>require&#095;files</tt> option is intended for checking files
that the router may be going to use internally, or which are needed by a
transport (for example <i>.procmailrc</i>).
</p>
<p>
During delivery, the <i>stat()</i> function is run as root, but there is a
facility for some checking of the accessibility of a file by another user. 
This is not a proper permissions check, but just a &#147;rough&#148; check that
operates as follows:
</p>
<p>
If an item in a <tt>require&#095;files</tt> list does not contain any forward slash
characters, it is taken to be the user (and optional group, separated by a
comma) to be checked for subsequent files in the list. If no group is specified
but the user is specified symbolically, the gid associated with the uid is
used. For example:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;require_files = mail:/some/file
&nbsp;&nbsp;require_files = $local_part:$home/.procmailrc
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If a user or group name in a <tt>require&#095;files</tt> list does not exist, the
<tt>require&#095;files</tt> condition fails.
</p>
<p>
Exim performs the check by scanning along the components of the file path, and
checking the access for the given uid and gid. It checks for &#147;x&#148; access on
directories, and &#147;r&#148; access on the final file. Note that this means that file
access control lists, if the operating system has them, are ignored.
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning 1</b>: When the router is being run to verify addresses for an
incoming SMTP message, Exim is not running as root, but under its own uid. This
may affect the result of a <tt>require&#095;files</tt> check. In particular, <i>stat()</i>
may yield the error <font size=-1>EACCES</font> (&#147;Permission denied&#148;). This means that the Exim
user is not permitted to read one of the directories on the file's path.
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning 2</b>: Even when Exim is running as root while delivering a message, 
<i>stat()</i> can yield <font size=-1>EACCES</font> for a file on an NFS directory that is mounted 
without root access.
</p>
<p>
In both cases, 
the default action is to consider this a configuration error, and routing is
deferred because the existence or non-existence of the file cannot be
determined. However, in some circumstances it may be desirable to treat this
condition as if the file did not exist. If the file name (or the exclamation
mark that precedes the file name for non-existence) is preceded by a plus sign,
the <font size=-1>EACCES</font> error is treated as if the file did not exist. For example:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;require_files = +/some/file
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If the router is not an essential part of verification (for example, it
handles users' <i>.forward</i> files), another solution is to set the <tt>verify</tt> 
option false so that the router is skipped when verifying.

<h3>retry_use_local_part</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; see below<br>
<p>
When a delivery suffers a temporary routing failure, a retry record is created
in Exim's hints database. For addresses whose routing depends only on the
domain, the key for the retry record should not involve the local part, but for
other addresses, both the domain and the local part should be included.
Usually, remote routing is of the former kind, and local routing is of the
latter kind.
</p>
<p>
This option controls whether the local part is used to form the key for retry
hints for addresses that suffer temporary errors while being handled by this
router. The default value is true for any router that has <tt>check&#095;local&#095;user</tt>
set, and false otherwise. Note that this option does not apply to hints keys
for transport delays; they are controlled by a generic transport option of the
same name.
</p>
<p>
<font color=green>
The setting of <tt>retry&#095;use&#095;local&#095;part</tt> applies only to the router on which it 
appears. If the router generates child addresses, they are routed 
independently; this setting does not become attached to them.
</font>

<a name="IX1611"></a>
<a name="IX1612"></a>
<h3>router_home_directory</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
This option sets a home directory for use while the router is running. (Compare
<tt>transport_home&#095;directory</tt>, which sets a home directory for later
transporting.) In particular, if used on a <b>redirect</b> router, this option
sets a value for <tt>$home</tt> while a filter is running. The value is expanded;
forced expansion failure causes the option to be ignored &#150; other failures
cause the router to defer.
</p>
<p>
Expansion of <tt>router&#095;home&#095;directory</tt> happens immediately after the
<tt>check&#095;local&#095;user</tt> test (if configured), before any further expansions take
place. 
(See section <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a> for a list of the order in which preconditions
are evaluated.)
While the router is running, <tt>router_home&#095;directory</tt> overrides the value of
<tt>$home</tt> that came from <tt>check&#095;local&#095;user</tt>.
</p>
<p>
When a router accepts an address and routes it to a transport (including the
cases when a redirect router generates a pipe, file, or autoreply delivery),
the home directory setting for the transport is taken from the first of these
values that is set:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
The <tt>home&#095;directory</tt> option on the transport;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
The <tt>transport&#095;home&#095;directory</tt> option on the router;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
The password data if <tt>check&#095;local&#095;user</tt> is set on the router;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
The <tt>router&#095;home&#095;directory</tt> option on the router.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In other words, <tt>router&#095;home&#095;directory</tt> overrides the password data for the
router, but not for the transport.

<a name="IX1614"></a>
<a name="IX1615"></a>
<h3>self</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; freeze<br>
<p>
This option applies to those routers that use a recipient address to find a
list of remote hosts. Currently, these are the <b>dnslookup</b>, <b>ipliteral</b>,
and <b>manualroute</b> routers. 
Certain configurations of the <b>queryprogram</b> router can also specify a list
of remote hosts.
Usually such routers are configured to send the message to a remote host via an
<b>smtp</b> transport. The <tt>self</tt> option specifies what happens when the first
host on the list turns out to be the local host.
The way in which Exim checks for the local host is described in section
<a href="spec_13.html#SECT13.6">13.6</a>.
</p>
<p>
Normally this situation indicates either an error in Exim's configuration (for
example, the router should be configured not to process this domain), or an
error in the DNS (for example, the MX should not point to this host). For this
reason, the default action is to log the incident, defer the address, and
freeze the message. The following alternatives are provided for use in special
cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
<tt>defer</tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Delivery of the message is tried again later, but the message is not frozen.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<tt>reroute: &#060;<em>domain</em>&#062;</tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>
The domain is changed to the given domain, and the address is passed back to
be reprocessed by the routers. No rewriting of headers takes place. This
behaviour is essentially a redirection.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<tt>reroute: rewrite: &#060;<em>domain</em>&#062;</tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>
The domain is changed to the given domain, and the address is passed back to be
reprocessed by the routers. Any headers that contain the original domain are
rewritten.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<tt>pass</tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<a name="IX1616"></a>
The router passes the address to the next router, or to the router named in the
<tt>pass&#095;router</tt> option if it is set.
This overrides <tt>no&#095;more</tt>.
</p>
<p>
During subsequent routing and delivery, the variable
<tt>$self&#095;hostname</tt> contains the name of the local host that the router
encountered. This can be used to distinguish between different cases for hosts
with multiple names. The combination
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;self = pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;no_more
</pre>
</p>
<p>
ensures that only those addresses that routed to the local host are passed on.
Without <tt>no&#095;more</tt>, addresses that were declined for other reasons would also
be passed to the next router.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<tt>fail</tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Delivery fails and an error report is generated.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<tt>send</tt>
<br>
<a name="IX1617"></a>
</p>
<p>
The anomaly is ignored and the address is queued for the transport. This
setting should be used with extreme caution. For an <b>smtp</b> transport, it makes
sense only in cases where the program that is listening on the SMTP port is not
this version of Exim. That is, it must be some other MTA, or Exim with a
different configuration file that handles the domain in another way.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><a name="IX1618"></a>
<a name="IX1619"></a>
<h3>senders</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; address list, expanded (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
If this option is set, the router is skipped unless the message's sender
address matches something on the list. 
See section <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a> for a list of the order in which preconditions 
are evaluated.
</p>
<p>
There are issues concerning verification when the running of routers is
dependent on the sender. When Exim is verifying the address in an <tt>errors&#095;to</tt>
setting, it sets the sender to the null string. When using the <i>-bt</i> option to
check a configuration file, it is necessary also to use the <i>-f</i> option to set
an appropriate sender. For incoming mail, the sender is unset when verifying
the sender, but is available when verifying any recipients. If the SMTP
<font size=-1>VRFY</font> command is enabled, it must be used after <font size=-1>MAIL</font> if the sender
address matters.

<a name="IX1623"></a>
<h3>translate_ip_address</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
There exist some rare networking situations (for example, packet radio) where
it is helpful to be able to translate IP addresses generated by normal routing
mechanisms into other IP addresses, thus performing a kind of manual IP
routing. This should be done only if the normal IP routing of the TCP/IP stack
is inadequate or broken. Because this is an extremely uncommon requirement, the
code to support this option is not included in the Exim binary unless
<font size=-1>SUPPORT_TRANSLATE_IP_ADDRESS</font>=yes is set in <i>Local/Makefile</i>.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>translate&#095;ip&#095;address</tt> string is expanded for every IP address generated
by the router, with the generated address set in <tt>$host&#095;address</tt>. If the
expansion is forced to fail, no action is taken. 
For any other expansion error, delivery of the message is deferred.
If the result of the expansion is an IP address, that replaces the original
address; otherwise the result is assumed to be a host name &#150; this is looked up
using <i>gethostbyname()</i> (or <i>getipnodebyname()</i> when available) to produce
one or more replacement IP addresses. For example, to subvert all IP addresses
in some specific networks, this could be added to a router:
</p>
<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><tt>translate&#095;ip&#095;address = &#092;</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><tt>  &#036;&#123;lookup&#123;&#036;&#123;mask:&#036;host&#095;address/26&#125;&#125;lsearch&#123;/some/file&#125;&#123;&#036;value&#125;fail&#125;}</tt><br>
</p>
<p>
The file would contain lines like
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10.2.3.128/26    some.host
&nbsp;&nbsp;10.8.4.34/26     10.44.8.15
</pre>
</p>
<p>
You should not make use of this facility unless you really understand what you
are doing.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1624"></a>
<h3>transport</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
This option specifies the transport to be used when a router accepts an address
and sets it up for delivery. A transport is never needed if a router is used
only for verification. The value of the option is expanded at routing time, 
after the expansion of <tt>errors&#095;to</tt>, 
<tt>headers&#095;add</tt>, and <tt>headers&#095;remove</tt>,
and result must be the name of one of the configured transports. If it is
not, delivery is deferred.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>transport</tt> option is not used by the <b>redirect</b> router, but it does have
some private options that set up transports for pipe and file deliveries (see
chapter <a href="spec_22.html">22</a>).
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1625"></a>
<a name="IX1626"></a>
<h3>transport_current_directory</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; unset<br>
<p>
This option associates a current directory with any address that is routed
to a local transport. This can happen either because a transport is
explicitly configured for the router, or because it generates a delivery to a
file or a pipe. During the delivery process (that is, at transport time), this
option string is expanded and is set as the current directory, unless
overridden by a setting on the transport.
If the expansion fails for any reason, including forced failure, an error is
logged, and delivery is deferred.
See chapter <a href="spec_23.html">23</a> for details of the local delivery environment.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1627"></a>
<a name="IX1628"></a>
<h3>transport_home_directory</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; see below<br>
<p>
This option associates a home directory with any address that is routed to a
local transport. This can happen either because a transport is explicitly
configured for the router, or because it generates a delivery to a file or a
pipe. During the delivery process (that is, at transport time), the option
string is expanded and is set as the home directory, unless overridden by a
setting of <tt>home&#095;directory</tt> on the transport.
If the expansion fails for any reason, including forced failure, an error is
logged, and delivery is deferred.
</p>
<p>
If the transport does not specify a home directory, and
<tt>transport&#095;home&#095;directory</tt> is not set for the router, the home directory for
the tranport is taken from the password data if <tt>check&#095;local&#095;user</tt> is set for
the router. Otherwise it is taken from <tt>router&#095;home&#095;directory</tt> if that option
is set; if not, no home directory is set for the transport. 
</p>
<p>
See chapter <a href="spec_23.html">23</a> for further details of the local delivery
environment.
<hr></p>
<a name="IX1629"></a>
<a name="IX1630"></a>
<h3>unseen</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; false<br>
<p>
The result of string expansion for this option must be a valid boolean value,
that is, one of the strings &#147;yes&#148;, &#147;no&#148;, &#147;true&#148;, or &#147;false&#148;. Any other result
causes an error, and delivery is deferred. If the expansion is forced to fail,
the default value for the option (false) is used. Other failures cause delivery
to be deferred.
</p>
<p>
When this option is set true, routing does not cease if the router accepts the
address. Instead, a copy of the incoming address is passed to the next router,
overriding a false setting of <tt>more</tt>. There is little point in setting <tt>more</tt> 
false if <tt>unseen</tt> is always true, but it may be useful in cases when the value 
of <tt>unseen</tt> contains expansion items (and therefore, presumably, is sometimes
true and sometimes false).
</p>
<p>
<a name="IX1631"></a>
The <tt>unseen</tt> option can be used to cause
copies of messages to be delivered to some other destination, while also
carrying out a normal delivery. In effect, the current address is made into a 
&#147;parent&#148; that has two children &#150; one that is delivered as specified by this 
router, and a clone that goes on to be routed further.
</p>
<p>
Header lines added to the address (or specified for removal) by this router or
by previous routers affect the &#147;unseen&#148; copy of the message only. The clone
that continues to be processed by further routers starts with no added headers 
and none specified for removal.
</p>
<p>
However, any data that was set by the <tt>address&#095;data</tt> option in the current or
previous routers is passed on. Setting this option has a similar effect to the
<tt>unseen</tt> command qualifier in filter files.

<h3>user</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; string, expanded<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; see below<br>
<p>
When a router queues an address for a transport, and the transport does not
specify a user, the user given here is used when running the delivery process.
The user may be specified numerically or by name. If expansion fails, the 
error is logged and delivery is deferred.
This user is also used by the <b>redirect</b> router when running a filter file.
The default is unset, except when <tt>check&#095;local&#095;user</tt> is set. In this case,
the default is taken from the password information. If the user is specified as
a name, and <tt>group</tt> is not set, the group associated with the user is used. See
also <tt>initgroups</tt> and <tt>group</tt> and the discussion in chapter <a href="spec_23.html">23</a>.

<h3>verify</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; true<br>
<p>
Setting this option has the effect of setting <tt>verify&#095;sender</tt> and
<tt>verify&#095;recipient</tt> to the same value.

<h3>verify_only</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; false<br>
<p>
If this option is set, the router is used only when verifying an address or
testing with the <i>-bv</i> option, not when actually doing a delivery, testing
with the <i>-bt</i> option, or running the SMTP <font size=-1>EXPN</font> command. It can be further
restricted to verifying only senders or recipients by means of <tt>verify&#095;sender</tt>
and <tt>verify&#095;recipient</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning</b>: When the router is being run to verify addresses for an incoming
SMTP message, Exim is not running as root, but under its own uid. If the router 
accesses any files, you need to make sure that they are accessible to the Exim 
user or group.

<h3>verify_recipient</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; true<br>
<p>
If this option is false, the router is skipped when verifying recipient
addresses
or testing recipient verification using <i>-bv</i>.
See section <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a> for a list of the order in which preconditions 
are evaluated.

<h3>verify_sender</h3>
<i>Type:</i>&nbsp; boolean (precondition)<br><i>Default:</i>&nbsp; true<br>
<p>
If this option is false, the router is skipped when verifying sender addresses
or testing sender verification using <i>-bvs</i>.
See section <a href="spec_3.html#SECT3.11">3.11</a> for a list of the order in which preconditions 
are evaluated.
