<h2><a href="FAQ.html#TOC371">93. HP-UX</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="TOC372" href="FAQ.html#TOC372">Q9301:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm trying to compile on an HP machine and I don't have <i>gcc</i> there. So I
put <tt>CC=cc</tt> in the <i>Local/Makefile</i>, but I got this error:
</p>
<pre>
   (Bundled) cc: "buildconfig.c", line 54: error 1705: Function prototypes
     are an ANSI feature.</pre>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A9301:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;The bundled compiler is not an ANSI C compiler. You either have to get a
copy of <i>gcc</i> from the HPUX Software Porting Archives or buy the ANSI cc
from HP. The advice given by one user of HP systems on the Exim
mailing list was as follows:
</p>
<p>
<i>Personally, I wouldn't use anything but the ANSI C compiler. gcc
works for compilation, but it doesn't know squat about PA-RISC chips
past the 1.0 rev. Since then, HP has come out with PA-RISC 1.1, 2.0,
and 2.1, each with better features. gcc will compile for them, but it
doesn't produce anywhere near the optimization that HP's compiler
does.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>I took the gcc road when we moved from FreeBSD to HP-UX because I was
familiar with it. After 6 months, I had to go and re-port everything
over when we realized that gcc wasn't going to do it for us long-term.
If I could give advice to any new HP-UX admin: don't use gcc if you
can afford the ANSI C compiler.  Based on the cost of even the lowest
HP workstation, that usually isn't a problem.</i>
