<a name="TOC329" href="FAQ.html#TOC329">Q2000:</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any Y2K issues with Exim?
</p>
<p>
<font color="#00BB00">A2000:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;The author of Exim believes that it is Y2K-compliant, as long as the
underlying operating system and C library are. Exim does not parse dates
or times at all. Internally, it makes some use of binary timestamps in
Unix format (number of seconds since 1-Jan-1970) and uses C library
services to convert these to printing forms (e.g. for logging). The
printing forms all use 4-digit years. Some people have tried various
tests. No problems have been reported, but details of what tests have
been done are not available.
</p>
<p>
Well, it's now November 2001, and no Y2K problems have been reported, so
it looks like I was right. This entry is retained as historical
nostalgia.
