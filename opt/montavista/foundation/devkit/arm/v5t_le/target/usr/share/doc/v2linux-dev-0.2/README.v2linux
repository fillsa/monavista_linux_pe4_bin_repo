Linux Wind River VxWorks (R) Virtual Machine Readme

The accompanying GNU gzipped tar archive contains the following components:
   o  source code for an introductory level Linux-based simulator
      for a Wind River VxWorks (R) environment.
   o  source code for a VxWorks (R) application which functions as a validation
      test for the above
   o  source code for a VxWorks (R) demo program for the simulator
   o  makefiles for the validation test (Makefile) and the demo (Makedemo)
   o  executables for the validation test (validate) and the demo (demo)
      for an intel-based PC Linux platform

NOTE: VxWorks is a registered trademark of Wind River Systems, Inc.

This package is best if accompanied by an associated white paper,
also available from MontaVista Software.

The package was developed on an 'out of the box' RedHat 6.2 Linux system,
and the Makefile paths, etc. reflect that environment.  For an actual
embedded Linux target, you will be better advised to start with a functioning
Hard Hat Linux cross-development environment from MontaVista Software.
MontaVista also has several kernel patches, etc. to improve the performance
of the VxWorks Virtual Machine and other embedded Linux applications.

The command 'tar tvzf v2linux.tgz' will produce a listing of the contents
without actually extracting them.  'tar xzf v2linux.tgz' will create a
'v2pthreads' subdirectory in the current working directory and will extract all
archived files into the 'v2pthreads' subdirectory.

To install the package, select a directory and copy the tar file into it.
The archive will be extracted into a subdirectory called 'v2pthreads'.
In case you are unfamiliar with Linux and the GNU tar utility, the command is:
tar -xzf v2linux.tgz

To run either of the executables you must be logged in as 'root'.  From
the v2pthreads directory, type either 'demo' or 'validate'.  Both
programs may be terminated by entering 'q' followed by the <Enter> key.
It may be helpful to redirect the programs' output to a file for later
examination.

The supplied makefiles may be used as examples for creating executables from
your own VxWorks (R) source code.  Note the compiler flags used.  These specify
linking with the pthreads library and the use of thread-safe REENTRANT
versions of C library functions where those are available. 

Note that this code is still largely experimental and is supplied on an
'as-is' basis with no guarantee of suitability or functionality for any
specific purpose or application.  With that in mind, please feel free to
experiment!
