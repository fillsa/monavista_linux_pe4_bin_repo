  # just add an alarm, you think !
  # Not, there is already one for the login timeout

  * would it be possible to give the capabilities of fbset to fbgetty also?
  # very interesting... but very hard to do.
  # it will be done !

From Yann Droneaud <lch@multimania.com>
  ! Add a config file option (one by tty) in etc
     /etc/fbgetty.d/tty[1-63]
     /etc/fbgetty.d/global
    This is good for adding capabilities of fbset

From Yann Droneaud <lch@multimania.com>
  ! Port to other unix-like OS that support virtual terminal.
    FreeBSD
    NetBSD
    ...
  # But is these OS have a framebuffer support ?
  # if not, fbgetty will just be able to refresh screen...
