If the widget is already realized, <i>XtRealizeWidget</i>
  simply returns.  Otherwise, it performs the following: 
<ul>
<li>Binds all action
names in the widget's translation table to procedures (see Section 10.1.2).
</li><li>Makes a post-order traversal of the widget tree rooted at the specified
widget and calls the change_managed procedure of each composite widget
that has one or more managed children. </li><li>Constructs an <i>XSetWindowAttributes</i>
  structure filled in with information derived from the  <i>Core</i>   widget
fields and calls the realize procedure for the widget, which adds any widget-specific
attributes and creates the X window. </li><li>If the widget is not a subclass of
 <i>compositeWidgetClass</i>,   <i>XtRealizeWidget</i>   returns; otherwise, it continues
and performs the following: <blockquote></dd>

<dt>-</dt>
<dd>Descends recursively to each of the widget's
managed children and calls the realize procedures. Primitive widgets that
instantiate children are responsible for realizing those children themselves.
</dd>

<dt>-</dt>
<dd>Maps all of the managed children windows that have mapped_when_managed
 <i>True</i>.   (If a widget is managed but mapped_when_managed is  <i>False</i>,   the
widget is allocated visual space but is not displayed. Some people seem
to like this to indicate certain states.) </dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the widget is a top-level shell
widget (that is, it has no parent), and mapped_when_managed is  <i>True</i>, 
 <i>XtRealizeWidget</i>   maps the widget window. <p>
The <i>XtIsRealized</i>   function returns
 <i>True</i>   if the widget has been realized, that is, if the widget has a nonzero
X window ID. <p>
Some widget procedures (for example, set_values) might wish
to operate differently after the widget has been realized. <p>
The <i>XtUnrealizeWidget</i>
  function destroys the windows of an existing widget and all of its children
(recursively down the widget tree). To recreate the windows at a later time,
call <i>XtRealizeWidget</i>   again. If the widget was managed,  it will be unmanaged
automatically before its window is freed.
