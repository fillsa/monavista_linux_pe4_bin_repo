<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The <i>XSetSelectionOwner</i>
  function changes the owner and last-change time for the specified selection
and has no effect if the specified time is earlier than the current last-change
time of the specified selection  or is later than the current X server
time. Otherwise, the last-change time is set to the specified time, with
<i>CurrentTime</i>   replaced by the current server time. If the owner window is
specified as <i>None</i>,   then the owner of the selection becomes  <i>None</i>   (that
is, no owner). Otherwise, the owner of the selection becomes the client
executing the request. <p>
If the new owner (whether a client or <i>None</i>)   is
not the same as the current owner of the selection and the current owner
is not <i>None</i>,   the current owner is sent a  <i>SelectionClear</i>   event. If the
client that is the owner of a selection is later terminated (that is, its
connection is closed) or if the owner window it has specified in the request
is later destroyed, the owner of the selection automatically reverts to
<i>None</i>,   but the last-change time is not affected. The selection atom is uninterpreted
by the X server. <i>XGetSelectionOwner</i>   returns the owner window, which is
reported in  <i>SelectionRequest</i>   and <i>SelectionClear</i>   events. Selections
are global to the X server. <p>
<i>XSetSelectionOwner</i>   can generate <i>BadAtom</i>  
and <i>BadWindow</i>   errors. <p>
The <i>XGetSelectionOwner</i>   function returns the window
ID associated with the window that currently owns the specified selection.
If no selection was specified, the function returns the constant <i>None</i>. 
 If <i>None</i>   is returned, there is no owner for the selection. <p>
<i>XGetSelectionOwner</i>
  can generate a <i>BadAtom</i>   error. <p>
<i>XConvertSelection</i>   requests that the
specified selection be converted to the specified target type: 
<ul>
<li>If the specified
selection has an owner, the X server sends a <i>SelectionRequest</i>   event to
that owner. </li><li>If no owner for the specified selection exists, the X server
generates a <i>SelectionNotify</i>   event to the requestor with property <i>None</i>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The arguments are passed on unchanged in either of the events. There are
two predefined selection atoms: PRIMARY and SECONDARY. <p>
<i>XConvertSelection</i>
  can generate <i>BadAtom</i>   and <i>BadWindow</i>   errors.
