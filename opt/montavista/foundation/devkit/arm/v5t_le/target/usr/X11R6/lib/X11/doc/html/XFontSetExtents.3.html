The <i>XFontSetExtents</i>   structure contains: <p>

<pre>0
0>=40 .vs 0u
0<=39 .vs 0p
typedef struct {
<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;XRectangle max_ink_extent;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;/* over all drawable characters */
<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;XRectangle max_logical_extent;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;/* over all drawable characters */
} XFontSetExtents;

</pre> <p>
The  <i>XRectangle</i>   structures used to return font set metrics are the usual
Xlib screen-oriented  rectangles with x, y giving the upper left corner,
and width and height always positive. <p>
The max_ink_extent member gives the
maximum extent, over all drawable characters, of the rectangles that bound
the character glyph image drawn in the foreground color, relative to a
constant origin. See  <i>XmbTextExtents</i>   and <i>XwcTextExtents</i>   for detailed
semantics. <p>
The max_logical_extent member gives the maximum extent, over
all drawable characters, of the rectangles  that specify minimum spacing
to other graphical features, relative to a constant origin. Other graphical
features drawn by the client, for example, a border surrounding the text,
should not intersect this rectangle. The max_logical_extent member should
be used to compute minimum  interline spacing and the minimum area that
must be allowed in a text field to draw a given number of arbitrary characters.
<p>
Due to context-dependent rendering, appending a given character to a string
may change  the string's extent by an amount other than that character's
individual extent.
