<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<p>
These commands are  <b>SAMPLE CLIENTS</b> provided with the
XTrap X Server Extension Sources, Version 3.3. XTrap is an X Server  extension
which facilitates the capturing of server protocol and synthesizing core
input events. Information on how to obtain these sources can be found in
the SOURCES section below. <p>
The  <b>xtrapreset</b> command is the simplest XTrap
client in that it merely performs an XQueryExtension() against XTrap.  The
name "reset" is historical.  The  <i>display</i> argument is parsed by the X Toolkit
and specifies the display where XTrap is to be loaded; see <a href='X.1.html'>X(1)</a>
. <p>
<b>xtrapinfo</b>
displays general configuration information as a result of an GetAvailable
XTrap request to the specified server.  It is simply designed to test the
request/response mechanism of the XTrap extension and client library as
well as display the configuration information that it finds. <p>
<b>xtrapstats</b>
tests the event and request vectoring of the server extension by configuring
XTrap to collect usage statistics on all core input events and requests.
 It has a primitive command-line interface for showing the counters, zeroing
out the counters, and quitting the program. <p>
<b>xtrapout</b> tests the output transport
from the XTrap extension to the XTrap client library.   As an aside, since
xtrapout has the capability of "recording" events and requests it receives,
 <b>xtrapout</b> is ideal for providing input to test  <b>xtrapin.</b> Since events are
the only concern for the input transport, the -e flag can be specified to
indicate that all input events (and only events) should be recorded by
<b>xtrapout.</b> <i>script</i> is specified primarily for non-U*IX machines which don't
support I/O  re-direction easily. The -v flag is used to force recording of
all requests and input events. <p>
<b>xtrapin</b> is used to test the input transport
to the XTrap server extension.  As stated earlier, it's input can be provided
by  <b>xtrapout</b> using the -e qualifier.  While it's primary function is for testing
XTrap and serving as an example for XTrap functionality, it can reasonably
used as a primitive "playback" client for X sessions. <p>
<b>xtrapchar</b> parses ANSI
character sequences including application program sequences to  synthesize
input events to X Window servers using the XTrap server extension. The intent
of this program is to serve as a sample implementation for  interfacing
character-based alternative input sources into X servers (e.g. voice recognition
systems).  Another application might be "remote keyboards". The -v flag causes
the program to display XTrap configuration information  and echo's characters
processed to stdout.  If present, this must be the  first argument. <p>
Note:
  <b>xtrapchar </b> has only been used with Digital Workstations using the  LK201
compatible keyboard.  Though reasonable effort was done to maintain  portability,
 no claims are made as to the current level of portability to  non-DEC servers
for this program. <p>
The <b>xtrapproto</b> command is a regression test designed to
test the basic XTrap protocol between a client and server.  If a given implementation
is suspect, the results of this test should be sent to an XTrap implementor
and/or developer.

Note</a></h2>
<p>
 Digital participated in the X Consortium's xtest working group which
 chose to evolve XTrap functionality into a new extension for X11/R6 known
as the RECORD extension (XTrap input synthesis functionality is currently
covered by the XTEST extension).  It is strongly suggested that users of
XTrap technology begin developing against RECORD/XTEST as it is the intention
of the X Consortium to drive these two extensions in the standards process
for providing the protocol capturing/synthesis functionality.  Some members
of the xtest working group are actively researching migration issues between
XTrap and RECORD.  If you'd like to contribute, please participate!  Contact
your local X Consortium Rep for details on how to be added to the xtest
mailing list.
