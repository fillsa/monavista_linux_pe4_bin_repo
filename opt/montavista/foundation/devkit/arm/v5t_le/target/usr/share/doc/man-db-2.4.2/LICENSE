This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the "man_db"
Manual Page Browser Utility Package Version 2.4.2; it was written 
by Graeme Wilford <G.Wilford@ee.surrey.ac.uk>, with documentation
reorganized by Nils Magnus <n_magnus@informatik.uni-kl.de>.

The author no longer works on it. Until 2001 it was maintained by the
late Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>. It is now maintained by
Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>.

The original upstream sources as maintained by Graeme Wilford are
available at ftp://ftp.ee.surrey.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/wilf/man_db/.

The current upstream source is held in CVS at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/man-db/, and future upstream
releases will take place from there.
