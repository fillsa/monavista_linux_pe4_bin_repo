xmkmf - create a Makefile from an Imakefile

<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>xmkmf</b> [ -a ] [ <i>topdir</i> [ <i>curdir</i> ] ] 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
The <i>xmkmf</i> command
is the normal way to create a <i>Makefile</i>  from an <i>Imakefile</i> shipped with
third-party software. <p>
When invoked with no arguments in a directory containing
an <i>Imakefile,</i> the <i>imake</i> program is run with arguments appropriate for your
system (configured into <i>xmkmf</i> when X was built) and generates a <i>Makefile.</i>
<p>
When invoked with the <i>-a</i> option, <i>xmkmf</i> builds the <i>Makefile</i> in the current
directory, and then automatically executes ``make Makefiles'' (in case there
are subdirectories), ``make includes'', and ``make depend'' for you. This is the
normal way to configure software that is outside the X Consortium build
tree. <p>
If working inside the X Consortium build tree (unlikely unless you
 are an X developer, and even then this option is never really used), the
<i>topdir</i> argument should be specified as the relative pathname from the current
directory to the top of the build tree.  Optionally, <i>curdir</i> may be specified
as a relative pathname from the top of the build tree to the current directory.
 It is necessary to supply <i>curdir</i> if the current directory has subdirectories,
or the <i>Makefile</i> will not be able to build the subdirectories. If a <i>topdir</i>
is given, <i>xmkmf</i> assumes nothing is installed on your system and looks for
files in the build tree instead of using the installed versions.
