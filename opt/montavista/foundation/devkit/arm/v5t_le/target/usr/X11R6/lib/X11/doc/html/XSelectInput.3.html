<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The <i>XSelectInput</i>   function requests that the X server report
the events associated with the  specified event mask. Initially, X will
not report any of these events. Events are reported relative to a window.
If a window is not interested in a device event, it usually propagates
to the closest ancestor that is interested, unless the do_not_propagate
mask prohibits it.  <p>
Setting the event-mask attribute of a window overrides
any previous call for the same window but not for other clients. Multiple
clients can select for the same events on the same window with the following
restrictions: 
<ul>
<li>Multiple clients can select events on the same window because
their event masks are disjoint. When the X server generates an event, it
reports it to all interested clients. </li><li>Only one client at a time can select
<i>CirculateRequest</i>,   <i>ConfigureRequest</i>,   or <i>MapRequest</i>   events, which are
associated with the event mask <i>SubstructureRedirectMask</i>.   </li><li>Only one client
at a time can select a <i>ResizeRequest</i>   event, which is associated with
the event mask <i>ResizeRedirectMask</i>.   </li><li>Only one client at a time can select
a  <i>ButtonPress</i>   event, which is associated with the event mask <i>ButtonPressMask</i>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The server reports the event to all interested clients. <p>
<i>XSelectInput</i> 
 can generate a <i>BadWindow</i>   error.
