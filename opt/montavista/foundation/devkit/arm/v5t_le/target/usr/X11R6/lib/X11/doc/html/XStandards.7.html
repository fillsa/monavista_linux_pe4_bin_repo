XStandards - X Window System Standards
and Specifications 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
The major goal of the X Consortium was to promote
cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software
interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment. The X Consortium
produced standards - documents which defined network protocols, programming
interfaces, and other aspects of the X environment.  These standards continue
to exist in the X.Org Foundation releases. The X.Org Foundation also produces
specifications. Like X Window System Standards, these are documents which
define network protocols, programming interfaces, and other aspects of
the X environment.  Under the aegis of The Open Group, X Window System standards,
X.Org Foundation specifications, and other specifications are the basis
for portions of The Open Group's various CAE specifications. <p>
The status of
various standards, specifications, and the software in the X11R6.8 distribution,
is explained below.

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Non Standards</a></h2>
The X11R6.8 distribution contains <i>sample</i> implementations,
not <i>reference</i> implementations.  Although much of the code is believed to
be correct, the code should be assumed to be in error wherever it conflicts
with the specification. <p>
The only X Window System standards are the ones
listed above. No other documents, include files, or software in X11R6.8 carry
special status within the X Window System.  For example, none of the following
are standards: internal interfaces of the sample server; the MIT-SHM extension;
the Athena Widget Set; the Xmu library; the Xau library; the RGB database;
the X Locale database; the fonts distributed with X11R6.8; the applications
distributed with X11R6.8; the include files &lt;X11/XWDFile.h&gt;, &lt;X11/Xfuncproto.h&gt;,
&lt;X11/Xfuncs.h&gt;, &lt;X11/Xosdefs.h&gt;, &lt;X11/Xos.h&gt;, &lt;X11/Xos_r.h&gt;, &lt;X11/Xwinsock.h&gt;, and &lt;X11/Xthreads.h&gt;;
the bitmap files in &lt;X11/bitmaps&gt;. <p>
The Multi-Buffering extension was a draft
standard of the X Consortium but has been superseded by DBE as a standard.

<p> 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>X Registry</a></h2>
The X.Org Foundation maintains a registry of certain X-related
items, to aid in avoiding conflicts and to aid in sharing of such items.
<p>
The registry is published as part of the X Window System software release.
The latest version may also be found at <br>
<pre><tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&#32;</tt>&nbsp;ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/DOCS/registry
</pre>The X Registry and the names in it are not X Window System standards. <p>
