The accompanying GNU gzipped tar archive contains the following components:
   o  source code for an introductory level Linux-based simulator
      for a Wind River pSOS+ (R) environment.
   o  source code for a pSOS+ (R) application which functions as a validation
      test for the above
   o  source code for a pSOS+ (R) demo program for the simulator
   o  makefiles for the validation test (Makefile) and the demo (Makedemo)
   o  executables for the validation test (validate) and the demo (demo)
      for an intel-based PC Linux platform

NOTE: pSOS and pSOS+ are registered trademarks of Wind River Systems, Inc.

The command 'tar tvzf p2linux.tgz' will produce a listing of the contents
without actually extracting them.  'tar xzf p2linux.tgz' will create a
'p2pthreads' subdirectory in the current working directory and will extract all
archived files into the 'p2pthreads' subdirectory.

To compile pSOS+ (R) sources, a header file called 'psos.h' is required.
This file is not supplied with the archive as it is the exclusive property of
Wind River Systems, Inc..  It is assumed that anyone with an interest in this
simulator probably already has a copy of this header.  A header file named
'not_quite_p_os.h' will supply the requisite definitions for purposes of
recompiling the 'c' sources in the package.

The supplied makefiles may be used as examples for creating executables from
your own pSOS+ (R) source code.  Note the compiler flags used.  These specify
linking with the pthreads library and the use of thread-safe REENTRANT
versions of C library functions where those are available. 

Note that this code is still largely experimental and is supplied on an
'as-is' basis with no guarantee of suitability or functionality for any
specific purpose or application.  With that in mind, please feel free to
experiment!
