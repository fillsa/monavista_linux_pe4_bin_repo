<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<b>xfindproxy</b> is a program used to locate available
proxy services.  It utilizes the Proxy Management Protocol to communicate
with a proxy manager.  The proxy manager keeps track of all available proxy
services, starts new proxies when necessary, and makes sure that proxies
are shared whenever possible. <p>
The <b>-manager</b> argument is required, and it specifies
the network address of the proxy manager.  The format of the address is
a standard ICE network id (for example, "tcp/blah.x.org:6500"). <p>
The <b>-name</b> argument
is required, and it specifies the name of the desired proxy service (for
example, "LBX").  The name is case insensitive. <p>
The <b>-server</b> argument is also
required, and it specifies the address of the target server.  The format
of the address is specific to the proxy service specified with the -name
argument.  For example, for a proxy service of "LBX", the address would
be an X display address (e.g, "blah.x.org:0"). <p>
The <b>-auth</b> argument is optional.
 If specified, xfindproxy will read 2 lines from standard input.  The first
line is an authorization/authentication name. The second line is the authorization/authentication
data in hex format (the same format used by xauth).  xfindproxy will pass
this auth data to the proxy, and in most cases, will be used by the proxy
to authorize/authenticate itself to the target server. <p>
The <b>-host</b> argument
is optional.  If xfindproxy starts a new proxy service, it will pass the
host specified.  The proxy may choose to restrict all connections to this
host.  In the event that xfindproxy locates an already existing proxy, the
host will be passed, but the semantics of how the proxy uses this host
are undefined. <p>
The <b>-options</b> argument is optional.  If xfindproxy starts a
new proxy service, it will pass any options specified.  The semantics of
the options are specific to each proxy server and are not defined here.
 In the event that xfindproxy locates an already existing proxy, the options
will be passed, but the semantics of how the proxy uses these options are
undefined. <p>
If xfindproxy is successful in obtaining a proxy address, it
will print it to stdout.  The format of the proxy address is specific to
the proxy service being used.  For example, for a proxy service of "LBX",
the proxy address would be the X display address of the proxy (e.g, "blah.x.org:63").
<p>
If xfindproxy is unsuccessful in obtaining a proxy address, it will print
an error to stderr.
