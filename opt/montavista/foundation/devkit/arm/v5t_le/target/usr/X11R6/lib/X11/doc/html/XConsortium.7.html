XConsortium - X Consortium information 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
Release
6.3 of X Version 11 was brought to you by X Consortium, Inc. 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
The
X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware membership corporation.
 It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the MIT X Consortium. The purpose
of the X Consortium was to foster the development, evolution, and maintenance
of the X Window System, a comprehensive set of vendor-neutral, system-architecture
neutral, network-transparent windowing and user interface standards. <p>
The
X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.  In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium to provide
the technical and administrative leadership necessary to support further
development of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and the membership decided
it was in their best interests to move the consortium out of MIT and create
an independent, stand-alone organization.  All rights to the X Window System
were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, Inc. on January 1, 1994. X Consortium,
Inc. closed its doors on December 31, 1996.  All rights to the X Window System
have been assigned to the Open Software Foundation. <p>
The X Consortium was
financially self-supporting through membership fees. There are no license
fees associated with the use of X Window System standards and code developed
by the X Consortium.  Membership in the X Consortium was open to any organization
willing to execute a membership agreement. <p>
The X Consortium was a highly
participative body.  Members were encouraged to actively cooperate with
the staff and other members in the design and review of proposed specifications,
and in the design, coding and testing of sample implementations of those
specifications. <p>
The X Consortium accomplished most of its work using electronic
mail over the Internet, with individual mailing lists for working groups.
 Internet electronic mail connectivity was viewed as a requirement for
useful participation in X Consortium activities.  Meetings were held as
necessary, often in conjunction with industry conferences and trade shows.
