Sorry to delay in responding.  I sent your request to my management
and they had to discuss it (if they didn't, there would be no reason
to pay them).  While they continue to discuss it, I can tell you
informally the gist of what they will eventually say:

You are allowed to do just about anything with Expect.  You can even
sell it.  You need not ask our permission.  You need not pay for it.
(It is my understanding that your tax dollars, in effect, already have
paid for it.)

You should not claim that you wrote it (since this would be a lie), nor
should you attempt to copyright it (this would be fruitless as it is a
work of the US government and therefore not subject to copyright).

NIST would appreciate any credit you can give for this work.  One line
may suffice (as far as I'm concerned) although there should be
something to the effect that this software was produced for research
purposes.  No warantee, guarantee, or liability is implied.

My management is always interested in feedback on our work.  If you
would like to send letters of praise describing how Expect has helped
your business, we would be delighted.  Letters (on letterhead please)
are strong evidence used by policy makers when deciding where every
dollar goes.  If you want to send these letters to NIST directly, you
may send them to the following individuals:

Arati Prabahkar, Director
NIST
Admin Bldg, Rm A-1134
Gaithersburg, MD 20899

Ric Jackson, Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory
NIST
Bldg 220, Rm B-322
Gaithersburg, MD 20899

Howard Bloom, Manufacturing Systems Integration Division
NIST
Bldg 220, Rm A-127
Gaithersburg, MD 20899

Steve Ray, Manufacturing Collaboration Technologies Group
NIST
Bldg 220, Rm A-127
Gaithersburg, MD 20899

In case you're wondering about the uninformative titles, Arati Prabahkar is the
director of all of NIST (about 3000 people) and Steve Ray (way down there
at the bottom) is my immediate supervisor (and of 10 other very lucky people).

I hope this has answered your questions.  Let me know if you have
further questions.
