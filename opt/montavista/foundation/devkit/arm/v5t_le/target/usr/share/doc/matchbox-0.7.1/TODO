Minors:

 - blocking event loop for dock
 - -geometry switch for minitime so it can be docked right.
 - 'gravity' on dock apps that are past the midpoint on rotation
 - Transparency option mbmenu to be transparent for just the root window
   rather than _everything_ behind it - like CE.

 - miniwave to clean/improve X leaving as is
 - xomonbut to import. X fixed, though not improted, needs new icon
 - miniapm slider

 - mbmenu broke on rotation ( size wize )
 - mbmenu keyboard control X
 - UTF8 xft handling in mbmenu / mbdesktop X
 - vfolder / .directory handling ( * started * )

General pending pain:

 - fix builds with no png / xft etc ( xft done - pngs started, see miniapm ) 
 - X11 Errors
 - General cruft removal, readability etc. 
 - change sprintf( tmp[xx] ) to snprintf's ?
 - test, Test, TEST !

Possibles / future :

 - Multiple mbdocks, run with env var specifying dock number.
   - switch for dock to specify number / do automatically
   - multiple config files ?
   - how to handle ordering ?
 - clock in mbdesktop --xid flag for all dockapps ?
 - patch gpe apps to use png window icon 
 - gtk matchbox management front end. 
 - xsettings improvements
 - plugin architecture for mbdesktop
 - expose / configure compression
 - 'remote' changing of desktop background ( mbcontrol ? )
 - task list dock app
