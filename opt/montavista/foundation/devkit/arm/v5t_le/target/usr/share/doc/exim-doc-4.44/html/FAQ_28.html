<h2><a href="FAQ.html#TOC410">99. LIST OF SAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS</a></h2>
<p>
As well as being hyperlinked from the HTML version of this document, each
sample configuration is also available as a file in the <i>config.samples</i>
directory, which can be independently downloaded.
</p>
<p>
Samples whose names are of the form Cnnn are Exim configurations; those with
names of the form Fnnn are filter file fragments; those with names of the form
Lnnn are sample <i>local_scan()</i> functions, and those with names of thf form
Snnn are scripts of various kinds. There are other examples of
<i>local_scan()</i> functions at a number of web sites (for example,
<a href="http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/sa.html">http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/sa.html</a>).
</p>
<p>
There are gaps in the C and F numbers because I have omitted the Exim 3 samples
that have not been converted for Exim 4.
</p>
<p>
<a href="C002.txt">C002</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``Although exim not intended for use in UUCP environment (it doesn't
know anything about bang!path addresses), I'm successfully using it for
delivering mail to UUCP clients.''
</p>
<p>
<a href="C006.txt">C006</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``This is how I have configured a PP-inspired vacationnote, there is
(was?) such a feature in PP. The user makes a file <i>tripnote</i> in his/her
home directory, the message is passed to the sender once with a short
leading text.''
</p>
<p>
<a href="C022.txt">C022</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``This is the Exim configuration file of a machine which delivers mail to
several local domains where the mail is delivered locally, several hairy
domains, handled as described below, and a half-virtual domain, which is
first processed by its special alias file, then processed as other local
domains (including the processing by the global alias file).''
</p>
<p>
<a href="C037.txt">C037</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; An elegant way of using ETRN, which does immediate delivery if the host
is online, but saves mail in a BSMTP file after some time on the queue.
ETRN then re-injects the mail.
</p>
<p>
<a href="C042.txt">C042</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``Since the Exim 4 configuration needed to get Mailman to work differs a
little bit from Exim 3 and since I still haven't seen a recipe for
Mailman with Exim 4, I'm providing my configuration (based heavily on
<a href="http://www.exim.org/howto/mailman.html">http://www.exim.org/howto/mailman.html</a>).''
</p>
<p>
<a href="C043.txt">C043</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``Attached is an Exim 4 config file which is designed for an Exim server
that is put in front of an Exchange 5.5 system but which verifies the
valid addresses that are stored in Exchange via LDAP lookups against the
Exchange server.''
</p>
<p>
<a href="C044.txt">C044</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``I thought I'd submit this as an example of an authenticated mail hub
configuration. Several people have asked for it so I thought it
might be of interest.''
</p>
<p>
<a href="C045.txt">C045</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``Here it is, for Exim 4.10 and Cyrus IMAPD 2.1.5 using db3/db4-format
mailbox database. This configuration delivers the messages to Cyrus
IMAPD using LMTP over a TCP/IP socket.''
</p>
<p>
<a href="C046.txt">C046</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``Deliver a duplicate of some proportion of all messages to a special
machine specified in the file <i>/MAIL_TAP_HOST</i>, if it exists.''
</p>
<p>
<a href="C047.txt">C047</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; A sample configuration for calling Spamassassin directly from Exim.
</p>
<p>
<a href="C049.txt">C049</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``I've been seeing a whole bunch of IPs that send me spam or virus mail
and HELOing as one of my own IPs, or as HELO one.of.my.own.domains (or
maybe HELO <tt>primary_hostname</tt>).''
</p>
<p>
<a href="C050.txt">C050</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; A configuration that uses the DNS to implement virtual domains.
</p>
<p>
<a href="F001.txt">F001</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``I thought that the rest of the list may be interested in reviewing our
filter as a starting point for their own system message filter.''
</p>
<p>
<a href="F002.txt">F002</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``... program which refused mail from unknown addresses until they mailed
me promising not to spam me ... since I'd already thought through how
to do it in Exim, and knew it'd be slightly easier than falling out of
bed, I went ahead and did it.''
</p>
<p>
<a href="F003.txt">F003</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``Here's four checks installed in our system wide filter that knock out
a lot of otherwise hard to detect rubbish.''
</p>
<p>
<a href="F004.txt">F004</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``This is an Exim filter snippet to change locally-generated <i>Message-Id:</i>
and <i>Resent-Message-Id:</i> headers to world-unique values.''
</p>
<p>
<a href="L001.txt">L001</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; A <i>local_scan()</i> function for Exim that calls <i>uvscan</i>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="S001.txt">S001</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; A Perl script for patching the name of the configuration file in an
Exim binary.
</p>
<p>
<a href="S002.txt">S002</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``When I moved from smail to exim I built a program that took individual
config pieces, stripped all the comments, and built a config file.''
