Included in this distribution is the file ``edt.sl''.  This requires JED
version 0.84 or greater to run.  To use it, put 

() = evalfile ("edt.sl");

in your .jedrc (jed.rc) file.  This document also includes some gold key
settings kindly donated by clifton@auriga.rose.brandeis.edu (James Clifton).
I have not installed these settings in edt.sl but I encourage you to look at
it. 

   Note: edt.sl will not work with jed386.exe.  See question 12 of
   jed_faq.txt for a way around this restriction.
   
	      Differences between EDT and Jed's EDT emulation
	      
Hopefully, you will not notice any difference if you use the keypad keys. I
have done my best to ensure that the functionality of the Application keypad
is preserved.

By default, JED binds ^H (control-H) to help.  Actually, it is a prefix
character for ^HC (showkey), ^Hf (describe function), ^Hm (man page), etc...
EDT (VMS) uses ^H to move to the beginning of the line.  If you want this 
behavior instead of JED's, then put the line

   unsetkey ("^H"); setkey ("bol", "^H");

in your jed.rc (.jedrc) file AFTER the evalfile ("edt.sl") statement.


Unfortunately, there appears to be no standard set of GOLD-X (X
represents a character in the set [A-Z]) key definitions.  For this
reason, I have defined only a few combinations. However, this should
not stop you from defining your own.  (See what James Clifton does
below)

I have defined 2 GOLD key combinitions:  GOLD-E and GOLD-Q.  Both of these
are bound to the exit command.

If you would like to bind the GOLD-X key combinations, then it is very easy.
For example, suppose you want GOLD-I to insert a file into the buffer,
GOLD-W to write the buffer to a file, and GOLD-S to switch to a previous
buffer.  Then add the following to your .jedrc (jed.rc) file:

    setkey ("insert_file",         "^[OPI");
    setkey ("write_buffer",        "^[OPW");
    setkey ("switch_to_buffer",    "^[OPS");

Note that the GOLD key actually returns 3 characters: escape (^[) O, and P.
The escape key on DEC keyboards as well as many others is equivalent to
pressing Control-[.  When JED see's the caret `^', it interprets it as
CONTROL.

In addition to the standard keypad, newer DEC terminals (vt220 etc) have a
smaller keypad (Find, Insert here, Prev SCreen, etc....). These have also
been bound.

Finally, JED does not support any EDT line editing commands, nor will it.
