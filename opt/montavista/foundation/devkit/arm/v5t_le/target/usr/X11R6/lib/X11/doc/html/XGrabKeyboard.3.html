<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The
<i>XGrabKeyboard</i>   function actively grabs control of the keyboard and generates
<i>FocusIn</i>   and <i>FocusOut</i>   events. Further key events are reported only to
the grabbing client. <i>XGrabKeyboard</i>   overrides any active keyboard grab
by this client. If owner_events is  <i>False</i>,   all generated key events are
reported with respect to grab_window.   If owner_events is  <i>True</i>   and if
a generated key event would normally be reported to this client, it is
reported normally; otherwise, the event is reported with respect to the
grab_window.   Both  <i>KeyPress</i>   and  <i>KeyRelease</i>   events are always reported,
independent of any event selection made by the client. <p>
If the keyboard_mode
argument is  <i>GrabModeAsync</i>,   keyboard event processing continues as usual.
 If the keyboard is currently frozen by this client,  then processing of
keyboard events is resumed. If the keyboard_mode  argument is <i>GrabModeSync</i>,
  the state of the keyboard (as seen by client applications) appears to
freeze, and the X server generates no further keyboard events until the
grabbing client issues a releasing  <i>XAllowEvents</i>   call or until the keyboard
grab is released. Actual keyboard changes are not lost while the keyboard
is frozen;  they are simply queued in the server for later processing. <p>
If
pointer_mode is  <i>GrabModeAsync</i>,   pointer event processing is unaffected
by activation of the grab.   If pointer_mode is  <i>GrabModeSync</i>,   the state
of the pointer (as seen by client applications) appears to freeze,  and
the X server generates no further pointer events  until the grabbing client
issues a releasing  <i>XAllowEvents</i>   call or until the keyboard grab is released.
Actual pointer changes are not lost while the pointer is frozen;  they
are simply queued in the server for later processing. <p>
If the keyboard is
actively grabbed by some other client, <i>XGrabKeyboard</i>   fails and returns
<i>AlreadyGrabbed</i>.   If grab_window is not viewable, it fails and returns <i>GrabNotViewable</i>.
  If the keyboard is frozen by an active grab of another client, it fails
and returns <i>GrabFrozen</i>.   If the specified time is earlier than the last-keyboard-grab
time  or later than the current X server time, it fails and returns <i>GrabInvalidTime</i>.
  Otherwise, the last-keyboard-grab time is set to the specified time (<i>CurrentTime</i>
  is replaced by the current X server time). <p>
<i>XGrabKeyboard</i>   can generate
<i>BadValue</i>   and <i>BadWindow</i>   errors. <p>
The <i>XUngrabKeyboard</i>   function releases
the keyboard and any queued events if this client has it actively grabbed
from either <i>XGrabKeyboard</i>   or <i>XGrabKey</i>.   <i>XUngrabKeyboard</i>   does not release
the keyboard and any queued events if the specified time is earlier than
the last-keyboard-grab time or is later than the current X server time. It
also generates <i>FocusIn</i>   and  <i>FocusOut</i>   events. The X server automatically
performs an  <i>UngrabKeyboard</i>   request if the event window for an active
keyboard grab becomes not viewable. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Diagnostics</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><i>BadValue</i> </dt>
<dd>  Some numeric value
falls outside the range of values accepted by the request. Unless a specific
range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's
type is accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate
this error. </dd>

<dt><i>BadWindow</i> </dt>
<dd>  A value for a Window argument does not name a defined
Window. </dd>
