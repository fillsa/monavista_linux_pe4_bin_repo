<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'></b>Description</a></h2>
<b>DMXQueryVersion()</b> returns version information about the DMX
protocol extension. <p>
Any incompatible changes to the protocol will be indicated
by a change in <i>major_version</i>. Small, upward-compatible changes will be indicated
by a change in <i>minor_version</i>. In general, <i>patch_version</i> is for informational
purposes and will encode the date of the last protocol revision (e.g., 20040604).

<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Return Value</a></h2>
If the DMX protocol extension is available, <i>major_version</i>,
<i>minor_version</i>, and <i>patch_version</i> will be set, and <b>True</b> will be returned.
 Otherwise, <b>False</b> will be returned. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Notes</a></h2>
At the time of this writing, the
DMX protocol is at version 2.2. <p>
Version 2.2 was the final development version,
and code supporting this version was submitted to upstream X server repositories
in the summer of 2004. <p>
Version 1.5 was the last of the 1.x series, which was
used for development before screen and input addition and removal were
supported. Version 2.0 and 2.1 were development versions that partially supported
screen and input addition and removal. <p>
Since we do not expect development
versions to be widely used, we recommend that any software that uses the
DMX protocol extension to support only versions 2.2 and above (although
they should detect earlier versions and either reduce functionality or
fail gracefully).
