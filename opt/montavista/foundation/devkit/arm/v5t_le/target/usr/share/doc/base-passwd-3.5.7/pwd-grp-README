The MontaVista Linux password and group files attempt to conform to the 
LSB, FHS requirements and informal Linux standards.

Before modifying the passwd and group files, you should not arbitrarily 
remove entries unless you are sure they will no longer be used.  Also 
changing the ID number of an entry is forbidden.  Reusing previously 
registered IDs should be avoided as well.

The LSB (LSB-Core-generic 3.0rc3) section 21.2 requires the following user 
and group names to exist on the system.  It does not specify an 
associated number, except that root shall equal 0.  However, User IDs 0 
to 99 should be statically allocated by the system, while 100 to 499 are 
reserved for dynamic allocation by applications.

  Table 21-1. Required User & Group Names
  _User_  _Group_ _Comments_
  root	  root    Administrative user with all appropriate privileges
  bin     bin     Legacy User ID/Group ID[a]
  daemon  daemon  Legacy User ID/Group ID[b]

  a. The bin User ID/Group ID is included for compatibility with legacy 
  applications. New applications should no longer use the bin User 
  ID/Group ID.

  b. The daemon User ID/Group ID was used as an unprivileged User ID/Group 
  ID for daemons to execute under in order to limit their access to the 
  system. Generally daemons should now run under individual User ID/Group 
  IDs in order to further partition daemons from one another.

  Table 21-2. Optional User & Group Names
  _User_   _Group_  _Comments_
  adm      adm      Administrative special privileges
  lp       lp       Printer special privileges

  uucp     uucp     UUCP special privileges
  operator root     Operator special privileges
  man      man      Man special privileges

In addition to the above required items, the following additional user and
