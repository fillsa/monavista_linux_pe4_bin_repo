<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The
<i>XResourceManagerString</i>   function returns the RESOURCE_MANAGER property
from the server's root window of screen zero, which was returned when the
connection was opened using <i>XOpenDisplay</i>.   The property is converted from
type STRING to the current locale. The conversion is identical to that produced
by  <i>XmbTextPropertyToTextList</i>   for a single element STRING property. The
returned string is owned by Xlib and should not be freed by the client.
The property value must be in a format that is acceptable to <i>XrmGetStringDatabase</i>.
  If no property exists, NULL is returned. <p>
The <i>XScreenResourceString</i>   function
returns the SCREEN_RESOURCES property from the root window of the specified
screen. The property is converted from type STRING to the current locale.
The conversion is identical to that produced by  <i>XmbTextPropertyToTextList</i>
  for a single element STRING property. The property value must be in a
format that is acceptable to <i>XrmGetStringDatabase</i>.   If no property exists,
NULL is returned. The caller is responsible for freeing the returned string
by using <i>XFree</i>.
